# Getting Started

*Marooned on an uncharted island, caught between two warring tribes, and
threatened at all hours by a dormant volcano prophesied to awaken again.
Can our brave heroes discover the legend of Starfall Island before they
fall prey to its denizens?*

In this introductory adventure, you’ll learn the basic rules for Open
Legend by playing through an adventure. One player will take the part of
the game master (or GM) and be responsible for directing the adventure
and controlling the enemies, monsters, and non-player characters (NPCs).
The rest of the players will act as the player characters (or PCs), each
controlling a hero of legend who will accomplish great things.

If you enjoy this basic set, be sure to check out the full rules,
available for free at
[**www.openlegendrpg.com**](http://www.openlegendrpg.com)

## How to Use this Adventure

The game master should read this packet inside and out, attempting to
understand the rules of the game and the progression of the story as
much as possible. A GM serves as both director of the story and referee
of the rules, so the more prepared the GM, the more smoothly the game
will play.

The rest of the players won’t need to prepare at all. This adventure
presents the rules in a layered manner, starting with the very basics of
character creation. From there, you’ll learn how to play *Open Legend*
by playing, with each new scene adding another layer to the rules. It
may be helpful to print out additional copies of the pages describing
character creation for each player, as well as the bane and boon
descriptions.

Players who are already familiar with the *Open Legend* Core Rules - or
those who feel ready to learn - can still enjoy *A Star Once Fallen*.
Just ignore the character creation rules presented below and create
first level characters using the standard rules.

Now grab some Mountain Dew or crack open a cold one. Prepare to be
loosed from the shackles of your ordinary, everyday life into a new and
exciting world of fantasy with *Open Legend.*

## Background

Before the adventure begins - even before the players create their
characters, perhaps - read the following introductory text:

\newpage

+++ {.CalloutInformation}
\
\

*You thought the job would be easy. Hitch a ride on a trading vessel, protect it from pirates, and earn a few gold and a free trip to the City of Sails. All in a day’s work for an adventurer like yourself. But there’s not much your swords and arrows and spells can do against a typhoon. You don’t remember much - the flash of lightning, the howl of wind, the doomful crack of the mast as it split down the middle - but one memory stands out perfectly in your mind.*

*Traveling aboard the ship was a fortune teller, an old hag that was great aunt to the captain or something like that. On the night before the typhoon struck, she told your fortune, and her words are emblazoned in your memory:*

```
A star once fallen upon the land,
Brings sword and axe and spell at hand.
For planted deep like evil seed
It fills heart, soul, and mind with greed.

Shoulders broad and voices tiny
Ceaseless war of clashing armies.
In sleep, the beauty whispers well,
But her wormtongue song is ever fell.

A royal staff in hands upright
Shall end the long, eternal fight.
But try you might, and try you may
The star will rise another day.
```

+++

## Character Creation

Each player will control a unique character of their own creation. At
their core, characters are defined by their attributes, which represent
their physical, mental, social, and supernatural abilities. Attributes
range from 0 to 9, the higher the better.

Whether you want to play a nimble acrobat who darts in and out of combat
with lightning speed, a raging berserker who dives into the fray, or a
sorceress of ice and necromancy who rains death upon her foes from the
back lines, your attributes define the epic deeds that you can
accomplish. The Attributes at a Glance tables provide summaries of the
type of tasks that each attribute is used for.

## Record Attribute Dice

Every attribute score above 0 grants you bonus dice to increase your
chance of success. Consult the Attribute Dice table for each of your
attributes and record the appropriate dice. (You’ll learn what to do
with these dice later on.)

\newpage

#### Attribute Dice

\NextTableColumns{OCT{.50}OCT{.50}}

## Calculate Defenses and Hit Points

You have three defenses - fortitude, evasion, and resolve - which will
protect you from different types of attacks. Calculate your defenses
using the formulas below and record them on your character sheet.

### Defenses

\NextTableColumns{OCT{1}}

| |
| |
| **Toughness** = 10 + Fortitude |
| **Evasion** = 10 + Agility |
| **Resolve** = 10 + Presence + Will |

Your hit points (or HP) are an abstract measure of how well you can
ignore pain, avoid deadly blows, and maintain a presence on the
battlefield in spite of wounds or exhaustion. If they reach zero, you
fall unconscious and are at risk of death. Calculate your maximum hit
points using the formula below and record them on your character sheet.

### Hit Points

\NextTableColumns{OCT{1}}

| |
| |
| **Hit Points** = 2 x (Fortitude + Presence + Will) + 10 |

*That is, add your Fortitude, Presence, and Will scores. Multiply the
total by 2. Finally, add 10.*

## Choose Starting Equipment

From the tables below choose up to one suit of armor and either three
weapons or a two weapons and a shield. Note that armor may require a
certain Fortitude score to use and may also reduce your movement speed.
Adjust your defenses according to any armor or shields you choose.
Record your equipment and their properties on your character sheet.

| **Scale Mail** | requires fortitude 4, +6 to evasion and toughness, -5’ speed |

\newpage

## Describe Your Character

Once everyone has a character, go around the table and tell the group
about who you’ll be playing. Are you a noble dwarven warrior displaced
from your delve by an evil dragon? A high elven enchanter travelling the
realm in search of magic to free your love from an ancient curse? A
half-angelic priest, fallen from grace and living amongst mortals in
hope of atoning for past transgressions?

Whatever your attributes say about your character, give yourself a
legendary story worthy of the heroic quest you are about to undertake.

**GM’S EYES ONLY BEYOND THIS POINT**

The rest of this rule book is only meant for the GM, who will share the rules with the PCs when the time comes. Players who read on risk spoiling the mystery and ruining the fun.

May a curse fall upon the dice of all PCs who read on. May they land ever on 1s and never explode!

# Game Master’s Overview

The paragraphs below provide you a look at the main plot of this
adventure and some of their historical origins. Becoming familiar with
these events will help you steer the narrative of the adventure based on
the actions of the PCs.

## The Unending Feud

Nearly a century ago, a great meteor fell from the sky and carved a deep
chasm into the center of the island. Following this cataclysmic
starfall, terrible unrest overshadowed the tiny jungle isle as the once
peaceful natives began a feud that has lasted ever since. On one side of
the war is the Wapuny tribe, a race of tree dwelling pygmy lizardfolk
who stand only knee high to the average human and reproduce in great
numbers. The other tribe, the Wapungos, are tall, broad-shouldered
humanoid warriors, fearless in combat - though far fewer in number than
their enemy.

The source of the unending war is greed for the star crystals. Deep
within the caverns at the center of the island is the Great Star, a
massive meteorite made of an alien pink gem. As soon as the star fell,
the natives began mining the precious ore, and not long after they began
fighting for it.

## The Secret Prison

Unknown to the natives, the meteor is actually a prison for the Demon
Lord Asgaroth, who was banished from a far distant plane eons ago. The
imprisoned demon hurtled through the cosmos for millennia until finally
crashing down upon this tiny uncharted island. It is the Demon Lord’s
evil presence that taints the native hearts with greed. With every
crystal that they chip from the Great Star, Asgaroth comes one step
closer to freedom. For a hundred years, the war between the Wapugnos and
the Wapunies has allowed neither of the tribes much freedom to mine the
star crystals, but a new arrival to the scene promises to change that.

## The Broken Heart

About five years ago, a ship crashed upon the shores of Starfall Island.
The lone survivor was a merchant named Eric Thorn, who had been
traveling aboard the ship with his new bride, Asha. The two were just
married and seeking a new life in a new land. Thorn was heartbroken by
the loss of his beloved, and combined with being marooned, he was driven
mad.

It wasn't long before Asgaroth, deep within the bowels of the island,
sensed Thorn’s agony and began communing with him. The Demon Lord
promised Thorn that he possessed the power to return Asha to life, if
only he were freed from his crystal prison. Slowly, Asgaroth began
gifting Thorn with dark powers, and the merchant-turned-necromancer took
up residence in the dormant volcano known as the Dragon’s Maw. He left
his wife buried in the northeast peninsula, vowing to return and free
her from the shackles of death. Since then, he has worked tirelessly on
a scheme to free the Demon Lord, and has grown in wickedness and
insanity in the process.

## The Dream Speaker

The necromancer’s plan involves eliminating the Wapunies so that the
Wapungos can be free to mine the star crystals, and thus release
Asgaroth. To accomplish this goal, he has spent several years
infiltrating the Wapungos by appearing to their chief, Bloodfist, in
dreams disguised as the most enchanting female he knows - his wife,
Asha. At the dream speaker’s request, and against the will of his
people, Bloodfist has begun reducing the Wapungo skirmishes with the
Wapunies. Thorn’s hope is that by focusing on defense, the Wapungo can
bide their time and grow in strength while also catching the Wapuny off
guard once the final stage of his scheme unfolds.

## The Undying Army

Once the Wapungo are strong enough and the Wapuny have sufficiently let
down their guard, the necromancer will then bolster the native forces
with an undead legion of his own creation. Thorn alone does not have the
power to raise such an army, but if he can retrieve the Scepter of Kings
from the ancient ruins at the southeast of the island, he will be able
to complete a ritual to summon the forces of the undead en masse and
then wipe out the Wapunies - allowing the Wapungo free reign to mine the
star crystals and thereby free the Demon Lord Asgaroth.

## The Prophecy

Five centuries ago, an evil and sorcerous race of snake men called the
Izzaru ruled the island before destroying themselves with their own
eldritch might. It was they who built the city that now lies in ruins
and their line of royalty who wielded the Scepter of Kings. The lords of
the Izzaru commanded even the power of nature with their magics, and
wielding the scepter, they could call forth magma from the Dragon’s Maw,
the volcano which overlooks the island. Since the fall of their kingdom,
the volcano had lain inactive, but the Izzaru long had told a prophecy
that still is whispered by the Wapuny and Wapungo: “When a king lays
claim to Starfall Island, the Dragon will spit flame once again.”

## How To Run *A Star Once Fallen*

*A Star Once Fallen* is meant to be played as a sandbox adventure. The
island is populated with plenty of beasts, mysteries, and
ne’er-do-wells, and the PCs are meant to explore the territory and
interact with its inhabitants according to their own motivation.

The adventure begins with a set opening scene that will introduce the
party to some of the goings on in Starfall Island and provide them with
a few possible courses of action. Following the opening scene, let the
players drive the story using the location and event encounters
described within this book.

The **location encounters**, as the name implies, are tied to a specific
location on the island map: the native villages, the Great Chasm, the
Dragon’s Maw, and so on.

The **event encounters**, on the other hand, can be used almost anywhere
to either indicate to the party that a great event has occurred (such as
Thorn retrieving the Scepter of Kings) or to reveal important secrets
(such as Chief Bloodfist’s dream visions). Use the event encounters to
spur the PCs to action.

## Potential Outcomes

Players will always surprise the GM, so don’t get dismayed if they take
this adventure wildly off the tracks. That being said, there are a few
outcomes that are more likely to develop in the plot based on how the
adventure is arranged. Be prepared for any of the following:

-   The PCs side with one of the tribes and lead them to victory over the other.

-   The PCs manage to form peace between the tribes.

-   The feud escalates to a final showdown that ends in the near extinction of both tribes.

-   The PCs find a way to escape the island and leave its inhabitants to their doom.

-   The necromancer tricks the PCs into giving him the Scepter of Kings.

-   The necromancer retrieves the Scepter of Kings before the PCs.

-   Asgaroth is freed and let loose upon the world.


## The Necromancer’s Scheme

The following checklist tells the likely turn of events if Eric Thorn’s
schemes go unhindered by the party. As the adventure unfolds, check off
a box whenever the story demands it, and do something to warn the party
of the impending doom.

-   Chief Bloodfist makes a complete withdrawal of his offensive troops.

-   The Wapunies begin mining the star crystal in great quantities.

-   Thorn retrieves the Scepter of Kings and begins his three day ritual, casting the island in cloud and shadow.

-   Thorn completes the Ritual of the Dead, summoning forth an army of undead.

-   At Asha’s beckoning, Chief Bloodfist launches full scale war against the Wapunies. Combined with Thorn’s army, the force wipes out the tiny lizardfolk.

-   The Wapungo mine the star crystal completely, and Asgaroth is loosed upon the world.


Feel free to modify the list or rewrite it according to the story being
told at your table. For example, if the party manages to convince
Bloodfist of Asha’s evil intentions, then Thorn will need to find a new
plan for gain access to the Great Star (perhaps by winning over the
Wapunies).

## The Necromancer’s Power

The power granted to Thorn by the Demon Lord Asgaroth is primarily a
power to control and commune with the spirits of the dead that wander
Starfall Island. Specifically, he can make these spirits take material
form as shadows. These shadows act as his eyes and ears throughout the
island, as well as his assassins. The shadows can animate the bones of
the dead and possess the dreams of sleepers. Thorn communicates with
them through a scrying pool kept within his volcanic lair.

As a demon, Asgaroth is strongly associated with fire, and he has also
bestowed such powers to his servant. Since Thorn took up residence in
the Dragon's Maw, it has begun to breath life again, though that fact is
still unapparent to outside observers. Magma churns and bubbles in the
depths of the volcano, waiting for a new king to claim the island and
set it free.

For the game mechanics behind Thorn’s powers, see Location H: The
Dragon’s Maw.

## Traveling Around Starfall Island

The island is approximately 25 miles wide and fairly rough terrain
throughout. Traveling from one end to the other would take most parties
about two and a half days if they are taking a standard 8-hour march.

In lieu of typical random encounters, you are encouraged to use the
event encounters during travel time as a way to keep every moment
relevant to the story. These events are described in the second half of
this book, and each one reveals a little more of the secret behind
Starfall Island.

## Escaping Starfall Island

Escaping the island is no easy task. The only shore worthy of launching
a vessel is the northeastern one upon which the party and necromancer
were shipwrecked. And, unfortunately, the tides surrounding this place
have been twisted by the malignant presence of Asgaroth, and any PC
trained in seafaring will recognize that something unnatural is at play.
The tides are unpredictable, and the reef is dangerous, making any
attempt to set sail a fool’s errand.

There are two ways to overcome this obstacle. The first is by sealing
the Demon Lord and thus releasing his clutch over the island (see
Location H: the Dragon's Maw). The other is by winning the aid of the
Wapuny shamans, who are so wise in the ways of weather that they can
predict the tides well enough even to overcome Asgaroth's trap. Earning
the Wapuny trust, however, comes at a great cost, and their chief will
not permit the shamans’ assistance for any prize less than the Scepter
of Kings.


# Starting the Adventure

## Opening Scene: Mud & Monkeys

To begin the adventure, read or summarize the following flavor text:

+++ {.CalloutInformation}
You awaken, one by one, with the gritty taste of sand between your teeth and the briny smell of the sea in your hair. As you regain your wits and stand to your feet, you can see the sun setting behind a distant mountain like a golden crown being set atop the head of a regal king. The beach you stand on is littered with wreckage, though little appears salvageable - a few of your weapons, some armor, a couple days rations, and maybe a length or two of rope.

In a daze, you fall back on your survivalist instincts and begin gathering what you need while you survey the surrounding land. Verdant jungles, herculean cliffs, and cascading waterfalls decorate this island, which might be a tropical paradise if only you weren’t stranded here. Miles off to the south, you barely have time to spy a great stone wall, as of a city, before the sun finally hides behind the mountains.

Just as darkness falls, you hear a panicked cry from the jungle not far off. The voice is high in pitch, like a child’s, though of a foreign tongue. Whatever the language, the meaning is clear: someone is in trouble.
+++

If the party investigates the jungle about 100 feet away, they discover
one of the native Wapunies being attacked by a pack of monkey bats -
grotesque man-sized creatures bearing the body and head of a monkey with
bat-like wings and feet. The agile Wapuny swings from vines and jumps
from branches to evade the creatures, but is soon knocked from the trees
into a muddy pool of quicksand. The monkey bats are descending for the
kill just as the party arrives.


+++ {.CalloutExample}
##### New Rules Unlocked: Action Rolls & Initiative
\
Throughout this adventure, you’ll find sections like this, which describe new rules to add to your game. As the GM, you should learn these rules and help your players learn them too. Typically, new rules are presented as part of an encounter in which those rules will play an important part.

##### Action Rolls
\
Action rolls are used to determine the outcome of important tasks. They are always tied to one specific attribute.

To make an action roll, you roll 1d20 plus any bonus dice granted by your relevant attribute. **Any dice that roll the maximum possible explode**, which means you can roll them again and add the new total to your action roll as well. Continue rerolling dice until none of them explode. Add all of the dice together to find your total action roll.

##### Advantage & Disadvantage
\
When you make an action roll within a particularly favorable situation, you have **advantage** on the action roll. For example, in this combat, a character who successfully swings from a vine to attack a monkey bat could gain advantage because of the extra momentum behind the attack. When you have advantage, roll one extra attribute die and remove the *lowest* attribute die before calculating your total.

You have **disadvantage** when you are acting with significant hindrance. For example, a character who gets stuck in the quicksand during this battle might have disadvantage on attacks until escaping. When you have disadvantage, roll one extra attribute die and remove the *highest* attribute die before calculating your total.

##### Roll for Initiative
\
When combat starts, each PC and each group of enemies makes an Agility action roll to determine their turn order. You should roll 1d20 + 1d8 for the monkey bats, and have each player make an Agility roll as well. Write all of the totals down in a list from highest to lowest. Characters take turns starting with the highest initiative. Once all combatants have taken their turns, a new round starts at the top of the initiative order.

**Swift Weapons**. Some weapons have the *swift* property. Any characters wielding such weapons at the start of combat gain advantage on their initiative roll.
+++

## Running the Combat

Whether they want to or not, once the PCs are within sight of the monkey
bats, combat ensues. The monkey bats are strong in number, and won’t
back down until they no longer have a chance.

To run a combat successfully, you should describe the scene and give
players plenty of opportunities to perform heroic deeds. At the start of
this combat, the Wapuny is waist-deep in quicksand with a monkey bat
grabbing him by the claws as 5 others circle above, flying or jumping
from branch to branch. Jungle vines hang all over the place, ready for
swinging adventurers - and there is no shortage of boulders to use for
cover or to attack from higher ground.

Make the combat memorable by taking it to the trees, the skies, the mud,
and all over the place. Divide the party if possible and put them in
tough situations, such as having to choose between helping an ally
swarmed with enemies or rescuing the Wapuny who just went under.

Don’t feel the need to keep running combat until all of the monkey bats
are dead, either. They are cowardly creatures - so a large show of force
or magical power might easily scare them off, and they’ll definitely
flee if outnumbered 2 to 1.

+++ {.CalloutExample}
##### New Rules Unlocked: Taking Turns, Damage, Banes & Boons
\
A combatant’s turn consists of one move action and one normal action.

Your normal action can be used to make a damaging attack, inflict a bane, or invoke a boon. Alternatively, you can trade your normal action for an extra move action.

##### Make a Damaging Attack
\
To damage a target, make an action roll. If you are using a weapon with the *precise* property, use your Agility for the roll. If your weapon is *forceful*, use your Might. Supernatural attacks use the relevant supernatural attribute (e.g., Energy to shoot a ray of fire).

Your attack roll is resisted by a specific defense of your target, as explained below:
- Precise weapons target Evasion
- Forceful weapons target Toughness
- Supernatural melee attacks target Toughness
- Supernatural projectile attacks target Evasion

Your total **damage dealt** equals your **attack roll** minus the **target’s defense**.

Damage is subtracted from the target’s hit points. When HP reach 0, a combatant falls unconscious. If an unconscious creature takes damage, it must make a Fortitude action roll greater than or equal to the damage or else it dies.

**Two-handed Melee Weapons**. If you are using a weapon with the *two-handed* property in melee combat, you have advantage on your attack roll. A weapon with the *versatile* property may be used one or two-handed, and also benefits from this advantage when wielded in two hands.

**Reach Weapons**. If you are using a weapon with the *reach* property, you may target foes up to 10’ away from you.

##### Inflict a Bane
\
Choose one bane from the bane list for which you have the required attribute score. Make an action roll against your target’s defense indicated in the bane description. If you equal or exceed your target’s defense, you target suffers the bane.

A bane typically remains in effect until the target resists it using a move action (see below). If a target fails three resist rolls against a bane, the bane can no longer be resisted. It persists for an extended duration indicated in the bane description.

##### Invoke a Boon
\
Choose one boon from the boon list for which you have the required attribute score. Make an action roll against the Challenge Rating equal to 10 + twice the boon’s power level. If your roll equals or exceeds the CR, designate an ally (or yourself) to receive the boon.

Boons typically remain in effect until you cease sustaining them. You may only sustain one boon at a time. If you invoke a boon while you are already sustaining one, the old boon is immediately dispelled.

##### Move Actions
\
You can use your **move action** to move up to your maximum speed (30 feet for most PCs). Alternatively you can use your move action to **resist any banes** from which you are suffering. Roll 1d20 for each bane affecting you. On a 10 or higher, the bane is removed.
+++

\NextTableColumns{OLT{.33}OLT{.67}}

| Monkey Bats (6) | 35’ speed, flying, climbing |
| - | - |
| Hit Points: 5 | Agility 3 (1d8) |
| | Fortitude 1 (1d4) |
| **DEFENSES** | Might 2 (1d6) |
| Toughness: 12 | Perception 2 (1d6) |
| Evasion: 14 | |
| Resolve: 10 | **FAVORED ATTACKS** |
| | **Claws**: Might vs. Toughness, damaging attack |
| | **Push**: Might vs. Toughness, inflicts knockdown bane |
| | **Grapple**: Might vs. Toughness, inflicts immobile bane |

## Adjusting Difficulty

For parties smaller than 5 PCs, reduce the number of monkey bats so that
there is one more monster than PCs. For large groups, add 3 hit points
to the monkey bats’ maximum for each PC beyond the fifth.

## Aftermath

If the party is successful in rescuing the Wapuny, he will be most
grateful. His name is Grik, and he will attempt to convince the party to
return to his village with him to be thanked properly.

Following the battle is also a good time to show the party the map of
*Starfall Island* to help them determine their next course of action.

+++ {.CalloutExample}
##### New Rules Unlocked: Healing
\

At the end of combat, characters who are conscious and take at least ten minutes to rest will regain all of their hit points. Unconscious characters (those at zero hit points) require more time to recuperate, regaining consciousness and all their hit points in 2d4 hours. If an unconscious character receives any healing (such as from the heal boon), he immediately regains consciousness.
+++

## Roleplaying Grik

Because the Wapuny speak a foreign tongue, this initial encounter with
Grik provides a fun opportunity for roleplaying. You can spend as much
or as little time with this as you and your players enjoy.

Use a high pitch, fast, and squeaky voice to speak for Grik - but
because he uses an unknown language, speak in gibberish. Use hand
gestures, or even drawings, to communicate with the players. Make this
encounter come to life by imagining that you really have no idea what
the PCs are saying. Enjoy the challenge of Grik attempting to
communicate both his own name and the name of his people, the Wapuny.
Keep this going for as long as it’s fun, and keep in mind that Grik’s
main goal is to express his thanks and bring the party back to his
village.

Action rolls aren’t just used for combat, but for any important action that will drive the story. For this reason, the *every roll matters* rule dictates that any roll **made by players** (not the GM) should be more than a simple pass/fail check.

Most action rolls have a Challenge Rating (CR) to indicate the level of difficulty. When a player’s roll meets or exceeds the CR, then the player succeeds. If a player gets lower than the CR, then the GM chooses to either allow the player to *succeed with a twist* or to *fail, but the story progresses*.

For example, after interacting with Grik for a while, one PC might decide to make a Logic roll to understand the Wapuny language. The CR for this task is 20. If a player gets a 20 on her roll, she can communicate with the Wapuny normally. If she fails the roll, you get to decide what happens.

If you choose for the character to **succeed with a twist**, this could mean that you will only speak to her with very simple words and sentences. If you choose to have the PC **fail, but the story progresses**, this could mean that you continue to speak in gibberish but tell the player that if she spends at least 48 hours interacting with the Wapuny, then she will be able to understand the language on a very simple level.

In a nutshell, *every roll matters* means that dice are never wasted in *Open Legend*. Players should only roll when the story demands it, and the outcome should drive the story forward in one way or another.

## What’s Next?

If the party chooses to travel with Grik, then you can proceed to the
Tree Town Location Encounter. Otherwise, allow the PCs to dictate their
course of action and use the events and encounters throughout the rest
of this book to guide you.

# Encounters

## Location A: Tree Town

This encounter takes place at the main village of the Wapuny tribe. They
call it **Glib Nab**, which translates to Tree Town. In this encounter,
the PCs may learn of the war between the two tribes, the curse of the
Big Head, and the Scepter of Kings.

+++ {.CalloutInformation}
*As you cut your way through the thick overgrowth of the jungle, you come upon a buzz of activity in the trees. It appears that a small village of bridges, ziplines, and ladders has been constructed in the trees. Tiny lizard men - no taller than your knee - crawl, swing, and climb through the branches, transporting water, keeping watch, and performing all manner of mundane deeds.*
