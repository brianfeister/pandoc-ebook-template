# A Star Once Fallen

A Learn-by-Play Adventure by Ish Stabosz for the Open Legend RPG System

*Marooned on an uncharted island, caught between two warring tribes, and
threatened at all hours by a dormant volcano prophesied to awaken again.
Can our brave heroes discover the legend of Starfall Island before they
fall prey to its denizens?*

In this introductory adventure, you’ll learn the basic rules for Open
Legend by playing through an adventure. One player will take the part of
the game master (or GM) and be responsible for directing the adventure
and controlling the enemies, monsters, and non-player characters (NPCs).
The rest of the players will act as the player characters (or PCs), each
controlling a hero of legend who will accomplish great things.

If you enjoy this basic set, be sure to check out the full rules,
available for free at

## How to Use this Adventure

The game master should read this packet inside and out, attempting to
understand the rules of the game and the progression of the story as
much as possible. A GM serves as both director of the story and referee
of the rules, so the more prepared the GM, the more smoothly the game
will play.

The rest of the players won’t need to prepare at all. This adventure
presents the rules in a layered manner, starting with the very basics of
character creation. From there, you’ll learn how to play *Open Legend*
by playing, with each new scene adding another layer to the rules. It
may be helpful to print out additional copies of the pages describing
character creation for each player, as well as the bane and boon
descriptions.

Players who are already familiar with the *Open Legend* Core Rules - or
those who feel ready to learn - can still enjoy *A Star Once Fallen*.
Just ignore the character creation rules presented below and create
first level characters using the standard rules.

Now grab some Mountain Dew or crack open a cold one. Prepare to be
loosed from the shackles of your ordinary, everyday life into a new and
exciting world of fantasy with *Open Legend.*

## Background

Before the adventure begins - even before the players create their
characters, perhaps - read the following introductory text:

++++ {.CalloutInformation}
*You thought the job would be easy. Hitch a ride on a trading vessel, protect it from pirates, and earn a few gold and a free trip to the City of Sails. All in a day’s work for an adventurer like yourself. But there’s not much your swords and arrows and spells can do against a typhoon. You don’t remember much - the flash of lightning, the howl of wind, the doomful crack of the mast as it split down the middle - but one memory stands out perfectly in your mind.*

*Traveling aboard the ship was a fortune teller, an old hag that was great aunt to the captain or something like that. On the night before the typhoon struck, she told your fortune, and her words are emblazoned in your memory:*

*A star once fallen upon the land,*

*Brings sword and axe and spell at hand.*

*For planted deep like evil seed*

*It fills heart, soul, and mind with greed.*


*Shoulders broad and voices tiny*

*Ceaseless war of clashing armies.*

*In sleep, the beauty whispers well,*

*But her wormtongue song is ever fell.*


*A royal staff in hands upright*

*Shall end the long, eternal fight.*

*But try you might, and try you may*

*The star will rise another day.*

## Character Creation

Each player will control a unique character of their own creation. At
their core, characters are defined by their attributes, which represent
their physical, mental, social, and supernatural abilities. Attributes
range from 0 to 9, the higher the better.

Whether you want to play a nimble acrobat who darts in and out of combat
with lightning speed, a raging berserker who dives into the fray, or a
sorceress of ice and necromancy who rains death upon her foes from the
back lines, your attributes define the epic deeds that you can
accomplish. The Attributes at a Glance tables provide summaries of the
type of tasks that each attribute is used for.

attributes and record the appropriate dice. (You’ll learn what to do
with these dice later on.)

## Calculate Defenses and Hit Points

You have three defenses - fortitude, evasion, and resolve - which will
protect you from different types of attacks. Calculate your defenses
using the formulas below and record them on your character sheet.

\FloatingTable

| Toughness = 10 + Fortitude |

Your hit points (or HP) are an abstract measure of how well you can
ignore pain, avoid deadly blows, and maintain a presence on the
battlefield in spite of wounds or exhaustion. If they reach zero, you
fall unconscious and are at risk of death. Calculate your maximum hit
points using the formula below and record them on your character sheet.

\NextTableColumns{OCT{1}}

\FloatingTable

| Hit Points = 2 x (Fortitude + Presence + Will) + 10 |
| - |
| |

*That is, add your Fortitude, Presence, and Will scores. Multiply the
total by 2. Finally, add 10.*
