# Getting Started

*Marooned on an uncharted island, caught between two warring tribes, and
threatened at all hours by a dormant volcano prophesied to awaken again.
Can our brave heroes discover the legend of Starfall Island before they
fall prey to its denizens?*

In this introductory adventure, you’ll learn the basic rules for Open
Legend by playing through an adventure. One player will take the part of
the game master (or GM) and be responsible for directing the adventure
and controlling the enemies, monsters, and non-player characters (NPCs).
The rest of the players will act as the player characters (or PCs), each
controlling a hero of legend who will accomplish great things.

If you enjoy this basic set, be sure to check out the full rules,
available for free at
[**www.openlegendrpg.com**](http://www.openlegendrpg.com)

## How to Use this Adventure

The game master should read this packet inside and out, attempting to
understand the rules of the game and the progression of the story as
much as possible. A GM serves as both director of the story and referee
of the rules, so the more prepared the GM, the more smoothly the game
will play.

The rest of the players won’t need to prepare at all. This adventure
presents the rules in a layered manner, starting with the very basics of
character creation. From there, you’ll learn how to play *Open Legend*
by playing, with each new scene adding another layer to the rules. It
may be helpful to print out additional copies of the pages describing
character creation for each player, as well as the bane and boon
descriptions.

Players who are already familiar with the *Open Legend* Core Rules - or
those who feel ready to learn - can still enjoy *A Star Once Fallen*.
Just ignore the character creation rules presented below and create
first level characters using the standard rules.

Now grab some Mountain Dew or crack open a cold one. Prepare to be
loosed from the shackles of your ordinary, everyday life into a new and
exciting world of fantasy with *Open Legend.*

## Background

Before the adventure begins - even before the players create their
characters, perhaps - read the following introductory text:

\newpage

+++ {.CalloutInformation}
\
\

*You thought the job would be easy. Hitch a ride on a trading vessel, protect it from pirates, and earn a few gold and a free trip to the City of Sails. All in a day’s work for an adventurer like yourself. But there’s not much your swords and arrows and spells can do against a typhoon. You don’t remember much - the flash of lightning, the howl of wind, the doomful crack of the mast as it split down the middle - but one memory stands out perfectly in your mind.*

*Traveling aboard the ship was a fortune teller, an old hag that was great aunt to the captain or something like that. On the night before the typhoon struck, she told your fortune, and her words are emblazoned in your memory:*

 \ \
A star once fallen upon the land, \
Brings sword and axe and spell at hand. \
For planted deep like evil seed \
It fills heart, soul, and mind with greed. \
 \ \
Shoulders broad and voices tiny \
Ceaseless war of clashing armies. \
In sleep, the beauty whispers well, \
But her wormtongue song is ever fell. \
 \ \
A royal staff in hands upright \
Shall end the long, eternal fight. \
But try you might, and try you may \
The star will rise another day. \

## Character Creation

Each player will control a unique character of their own creation. At
their core, characters are defined by their attributes, which represent
their physical, mental, social, and supernatural abilities. Attributes
range from 0 to 9, the higher the better.

Whether you want to play a nimble acrobat who darts in and out of combat
with lightning speed, a raging berserker who dives into the fray, or a
sorceress of ice and necromancy who rains death upon her foes from the
back lines, your attributes define the epic deeds that you can
accomplish. The Attributes at a Glance tables provide summaries of the
type of tasks that each attribute is used for.

\newpage

## Record Attribute Dice

Every attribute score above 0 grants you bonus dice to increase your
chance of success. Consult the Attribute Dice table for each of your
attributes and record the appropriate dice. (You’ll learn what to do
with these dice later on.)

### Attribute Dice

\NextTableColumns{OCT{.50}OCT{.50}}

## Calculate Defenses and Hit Points

You have three defenses - toughness, evasion, and resolve - which will
protect you from different types of attacks. Calculate your defenses
using the formulas below and record them on your character sheet.

### Defenses

\NextTableColumns{OCT{1}}

| |
| - |
| **Toughness** = 10 + Fortitude + Will |
| **Evasion** = 10 + Agility + Armor |
| **Resolve** = 10 + Presence + Will |

Your hit points (or HP) are an abstract measure of how well you can
ignore pain, avoid deadly blows, and maintain a presence on the
battlefield in spite of wounds or exhaustion. If they reach zero, you
fall unconscious and are at risk of death. Calculate your maximum hit
points using the formula below and record them on your character sheet.

### Hit Points

\NextTableColumns{OCT{1}}

| |
| - |
| **Hit Points** = 2 x (Fortitude + Presence + Will) + 10 |

*That is, add your Fortitude, Presence, and Will scores. Multiply the
total by 2. Finally, add 10.*

## Choose Starting Equipment

From the tables below choose up to one suit of armor and either three
weapons or a two weapons and a shield. Note that armor may require a
certain Fortitude score to use and may also reduce your movement speed.
Adjust your defenses according to any armor or shields you choose.
Record your equipment and their properties on your character sheet.

| **Chain Mail** | requires might 3, +5 to evasion, -5’ speed |
| **Scale Mail** | requires might 4, +6 to evasion, -5’ speed |

## Describe Your Character

Once everyone has a character, go around the table and tell the group
about who you’ll be playing. Are you a noble dwarven warrior displaced
from your delve by an evil dragon? A high elven enchanter travelling the
realm in search of magic to free your love from an ancient curse? A
half-angelic priest, fallen from grace and living amongst mortals in
hope of atoning for past transgressions?

Whatever your attributes say about your character, give yourself a
legendary story worthy of the heroic quest you are about to undertake.

## GM Info

# Game Master’s Overview

The paragraphs below provide you a look at the main plot of this
adventure and some of their historical origins. Becoming familiar with
these events will help you steer the narrative of the adventure based on
the actions of the PCs.

## The Unending Feud

Nearly a century ago, a great meteor fell from the sky and carved a deep
chasm into the center of the island. Following this cataclysmic
starfall, terrible unrest overshadowed the tiny jungle isle as the once
peaceful natives began a feud that has lasted ever since. On one side of
the war is the Wapuny tribe, a race of tree dwelling pygmy lizardfolk
who stand only knee high to the average human and reproduce in great
numbers. The other tribe, the Wapungos, are tall, broad-shouldered
humanoid warriors, fearless in combat - though far fewer in number than
their enemy.

The source of the unending war is greed for the star crystals. Deep
within the caverns at the center of the island is the Great Star, a
massive meteorite made of an alien pink gem. As soon as the star fell,
the natives began mining the precious ore, and not long after they began
fighting for it.

## The Secret Prison

Unknown to the natives, the meteor is actually a prison for the Demon
Lord Asgaroth, who was banished from a far distant plane eons ago. The
imprisoned demon hurtled through the cosmos for millennia until finally
crashing down upon this tiny uncharted island. It is the Demon Lord’s
evil presence that taints the native hearts with greed. With every
crystal that they chip from the Great Star, Asgaroth comes one step
closer to freedom. For a hundred years, the war between the Wapugnos and
the Wapunies has allowed neither of the tribes much freedom to mine the
star crystals, but a new arrival to the scene promises to change that.

## The Broken Heart

About five years ago, a ship crashed upon the shores of Starfall Island.
The lone survivor was a merchant named Eric Thorn, who had been
traveling aboard the ship with his new bride, Asha. The two were just
married and seeking a new life in a new land. Thorn was heartbroken by
the loss of his beloved, and combined with being marooned, he was driven
mad.

It wasn't long before Asgaroth, deep within the bowels of the island,
sensed Thorn’s agony and began communing with him. The Demon Lord
promised Thorn that he possessed the power to return Asha to life, if
only he were freed from his crystal prison. Slowly, Asgaroth began
gifting Thorn with dark powers, and the merchant-turned-necromancer took
up residence in the dormant volcano known as the Dragon’s Maw. He left
his wife buried in the northeast peninsula, vowing to return and free
her from the shackles of death. Since then, he has worked tirelessly on
a scheme to free the Demon Lord, and has grown in wickedness and
insanity in the process.

## The Dream Speaker

The necromancer’s plan involves eliminating the Wapunies so that the
Wapungos can be free to mine the star crystals, and thus release
Asgaroth. To accomplish this goal, he has spent several years
infiltrating the Wapungos by appearing to their chief, Bloodfist, in
dreams disguised as the most enchanting female he knows - his wife,
Asha. At the dream speaker’s request, and against the will of his
people, Bloodfist has begun reducing the Wapungo skirmishes with the
Wapunies. Thorn’s hope is that by focusing on defense, the Wapungo can
bide their time and grow in strength while also catching the Wapuny off
guard once the final stage of his scheme unfolds.

## The Undying Army

Once the Wapungo are strong enough and the Wapuny have sufficiently let
down their guard, the necromancer will then bolster the native forces
with an undead legion of his own creation. Thorn alone does not have the
power to raise such an army, but if he can retrieve the Scepter of Kings
from the ancient ruins at the southeast of the island, he will be able
to complete a ritual to summon the forces of the undead en masse and
then wipe out the Wapunies - allowing the Wapungo free reign to mine the
star crystals and thereby free the Demon Lord Asgaroth.

## The Prophecy

Five centuries ago, an evil and sorcerous race of snake men called the
Izzaru ruled the island before destroying themselves with their own
eldritch might. It was they who built the city that now lies in ruins
and their line of royalty who wielded the Scepter of Kings. The lords of
the Izzaru commanded even the power of nature with their magics, and
wielding the scepter, they could call forth magma from the Dragon’s Maw,
the volcano which overlooks the island. Since the fall of their kingdom,
the volcano had lain inactive, but the Izzaru long had told a prophecy
that still is whispered by the Wapuny and Wapungo: “When a king lays
claim to Starfall Island, the Dragon will spit flame once again.”

## How To Run *A Star Once Fallen*

*A Star Once Fallen* is meant to be played as a sandbox adventure. The
island is populated with plenty of beasts, mysteries, and
ne’er-do-wells, and the PCs are meant to explore the territory and
interact with its inhabitants according to their own motivation.

The adventure begins with a set opening scene that will introduce the
party to some of the goings on in Starfall Island and provide them with
a few possible courses of action. Following the opening scene, let the
players drive the story using the location and event encounters
described within this book.

The **location encounters**, as the name implies, are tied to a specific
location on the island map: the native villages, the Great Chasm, the
Dragon’s Maw, and so on.

The **event encounters**, on the other hand, can be used almost anywhere
to either indicate to the party that a great event has occurred (such as
Thorn retrieving the Scepter of Kings) or to reveal important secrets
(such as Chief Bloodfist’s dream visions). Use the event encounters to
spur the PCs to action.

## Potential Outcomes

Players will always surprise the GM, so don’t get dismayed if they take
this adventure wildly off the tracks. That being said, there are a few
outcomes that are more likely to develop in the plot based on how the
adventure is arranged. Be prepared for any of the following:

-   The PCs side with one of the tribes and lead them to victory over the other.

-   The PCs manage to form peace between the tribes.

-   The feud escalates to a final showdown that ends in the near extinction of both tribes.

-   The PCs find a way to escape the island and leave its inhabitants to their doom.

-   The necromancer tricks the PCs into giving him the Scepter of Kings.

-   The necromancer retrieves the Scepter of Kings before the PCs.

-   Asgaroth is freed and let loose upon the world.


## The Necromancer’s Scheme

The following checklist tells the likely turn of events if Eric Thorn’s
schemes go unhindered by the party. As the adventure unfolds, check off
a box whenever the story demands it, and do something to warn the party
of the impending doom.

-   Chief Bloodfist makes a complete withdrawal of his offensive troops.

-   The Wapunies begin mining the star crystal in great quantities.

-   Thorn retrieves the Scepter of Kings and begins his three day ritual, casting the island in cloud and shadow.

-   Thorn completes the Ritual of the Dead, summoning forth an army of undead.

-   At Asha’s beckoning, Chief Bloodfist launches full scale war against the Wapunies. Combined with Thorn’s army, the force wipes out the tiny lizardfolk.

-   The Wapungo mine the star crystal completely, and Asgaroth is loosed upon the world.


Feel free to modify the list or rewrite it according to the story being
told at your table. For example, if the party manages to convince
Bloodfist of Asha’s evil intentions, then Thorn will need to find a new
plan for gain access to the Great Star (perhaps by winning over the
Wapunies).

## The Necromancer’s Power

The power granted to Thorn by the Demon Lord Asgaroth is primarily a
power to control and commune with the spirits of the dead that wander
Starfall Island. Specifically, he can make these spirits take material
form as shadows. These shadows act as his eyes and ears throughout the
island, as well as his assassins. The shadows can animate the bones of
the dead and possess the dreams of sleepers. Thorn communicates with
them through a scrying pool kept within his volcanic lair.

As a demon, Asgaroth is strongly associated with fire, and he has also
bestowed such powers to his servant. Since Thorn took up residence in
the Dragon's Maw, it has begun to breath life again, though that fact is
still unapparent to outside observers. Magma churns and bubbles in the
depths of the volcano, waiting for a new king to claim the island and
set it free.

For the game mechanics behind Thorn’s powers, see Location H: The
Dragon’s Maw.

## Traveling Around Starfall Island

The island is approximately 25 miles wide and fairly rough terrain
throughout. Traveling from one end to the other would take most parties
about two and a half days if they are taking a standard 8-hour march.

In lieu of typical random encounters, you are encouraged to use the
event encounters during travel time as a way to keep every moment
relevant to the story. These events are described in the second half of
this book, and each one reveals a little more of the secret behind
Starfall Island.

## Escaping Starfall Island

Escaping the island is no easy task. The only shore worthy of launching
a vessel is the northeastern one upon which the party and necromancer
were shipwrecked. And, unfortunately, the tides surrounding this place
have been twisted by the malignant presence of Asgaroth, and any PC
trained in seafaring will recognize that something unnatural is at play.
The tides are unpredictable, and the reef is dangerous, making any
attempt to set sail a fool’s errand.

There are two ways to overcome this obstacle. The first is by sealing
the Demon Lord and thus releasing his clutch over the island (see
Location H: the Dragon's Maw). The other is by winning the aid of the
Wapuny shamans, who are so wise in the ways of weather that they can
predict the tides well enough even to overcome Asgaroth's trap. Earning
the Wapuny trust, however, comes at a great cost, and their chief will
not permit the shamans’ assistance for any prize less than the Scepter
of Kings.


# Starting the Adventure

## Opening: Mud & Monkeys

To begin the adventure, read or summarize the following flavor text:

+++ {.CalloutInformation}
You awaken, one by one, with the gritty taste of sand between your teeth and the briny smell of the sea in your hair. As you regain your wits and stand to your feet, you can see the sun setting behind a distant mountain like a golden crown being set atop the head of a regal king. The beach you stand on is littered with wreckage, though little appears salvageable - a few of your weapons, some armor, a couple days rations, and maybe a length or two of rope.

In a daze, you fall back on your survivalist instincts and begin gathering what you need while you survey the surrounding land. Verdant jungles, herculean cliffs, and cascading waterfalls decorate this island, which might be a tropical paradise if only you weren’t stranded here. Miles off to the south, you barely have time to spy a great stone wall, as of a city, before the sun finally hides behind the mountains.

Just as darkness falls, you hear a panicked cry from the jungle not far off. The voice is high in pitch, like a child’s, though of a foreign tongue. Whatever the language, the meaning is clear: someone is in trouble.
+++

If the party investigates the jungle about 100 feet away, they discover
one of the native Wapunies being attacked by a pack of monkey bats -
grotesque man-sized creatures bearing the body and head of a monkey with
bat-like wings and feet. The agile Wapuny swings from vines and jumps
from branches to evade the creatures, but is soon knocked from the trees
into a muddy pool of quicksand. The monkey bats are descending for the
kill just as the party arrives.


+++ {.CalloutExample}
##### New Rules: Action Rolls & Initiative
\ \
Throughout this adventure, you’ll find sections like this, which describe new rules to add to your game. As the GM, you should learn these rules and help your players learn them too. Typically, new rules are presented as part of an encounter in which those rules will play an important part.
\ \
+++

+++ {.CalloutExample}
##### Action Rolls
\ \
Action rolls are used to determine the outcome of important tasks. They are always tied to one specific attribute.

To make an action roll, you roll 1d20 plus any bonus dice granted by your relevant attribute. **Any dice that roll the maximum possible explode**, which means you can roll them again and add the new total to your action roll as well. Continue rerolling dice until none of them explode. Add all of the dice together to find your total action roll.

##### Advantage & Disadvantage
\ \
When you make an action roll within a particularly favorable situation, you have **advantage** on the action roll. For example, in this combat, a character who successfully swings from a vine to attack a monkey bat could gain advantage because of the extra momentum behind the attack. When you have advantage, roll one extra attribute die and remove the *lowest* attribute die before calculating your total.

You have **disadvantage** when you are acting with significant hindrance. For example, a character who gets stuck in the quicksand during this battle might have disadvantage on attacks until escaping. When you have disadvantage, roll one extra attribute die and remove the *highest* attribute die before calculating your total.

##### Roll for Initiative
\ \
When combat starts, each PC and each group of enemies makes an Agility action roll to determine their turn order. You should roll 1d20 + 1d8 for the monkey bats, and have each player make an Agility roll as well. Write all of the totals down in a list from highest to lowest. Characters take turns starting with the highest initiative. Once all combatants have taken their turns, a new round starts at the top of the initiative order.

**Swift Weapons**. Some weapons have the *swift* property. Any characters wielding such weapons at the start of combat gain advantage on their initiative roll.
\ \
+++

## Running the Combat

Whether they want to or not, once the PCs are within sight of the monkey
bats, combat ensues. The monkey bats are strong in number, and won’t
back down until they no longer have a chance.

To run a combat successfully, you should describe the scene and give
players plenty of opportunities to perform heroic deeds. At the start of
this combat, the Wapuny is waist-deep in quicksand with a monkey bat
grabbing him by the claws as 5 others circle above, flying or jumping
from branch to branch. Jungle vines hang all over the place, ready for
swinging adventurers - and there is no shortage of boulders to use for
cover or to attack from higher ground.

Make the combat memorable by taking it to the trees, the skies, the mud,
and all over the place. Divide the party if possible and put them in
tough situations, such as having to choose between helping an ally
swarmed with enemies or rescuing the Wapuny who just went under.

Don’t feel the need to keep running combat until all of the monkey bats
are dead, either. They are cowardly creatures - so a large show of force
or magical power might easily scare them off, and they’ll definitely
flee if outnumbered 2 to 1. \ \

+++ {.CalloutExample}
##### New Rules Unlocked: Taking Turns, Damage, Banes & Boons
\ \
A combatant’s turn consists of one move action and one normal action.

Your normal action can be used to make a damaging attack, inflict a bane, or invoke a boon. Alternatively, you can trade your normal action for an extra move action.

##### Make a Damaging Attack
\ \
To damage a target, make an action roll. If you are using a weapon with the *precise* property, use your Agility for the roll. If your weapon is *forceful*, use your Might. Supernatural attacks use the relevant supernatural attribute (e.g., Energy to shoot a ray of fire).

Your attack roll is resisted by a specific defense of your target, as explained below:

- Weapon attacks target Evasion

- Supernatural attacks target the most logical defense, either Evasion or Toughness

Your total **damage dealt** equals your **attack roll** minus the **target’s defense**.
+++

+++ {.CalloutExample}
\ \
Damage is subtracted from the target’s hit points. When HP reach 0, a combatant falls unconscious. If an unconscious creature takes damage, it must make a Fortitude action roll greater than or equal to the damage or else it dies.

**Two-handed Melee Weapons**. If you are using a weapon with the *two-handed* property in melee combat, you have advantage on your attack roll. A weapon with the *versatile* property may be used one or two-handed, and also benefits from this advantage when wielded in two hands.

**Reach Weapons**. If you are using a weapon with the *reach* property, you may target foes up to 10’ away from you.

##### Inflict a Bane
\ \
Choose one bane from the bane list for which you have the required attribute score. Make an action roll against your target’s defense indicated in the bane description. If you equal or exceed your target’s defense, you target suffers the bane.

A bane typically remains in effect until the target resists it using a move action (see below). If a target fails three resist rolls against a bane, the bane can no longer be resisted. It persists for an extended duration indicated in the bane description.

##### Invoke a Boon
\ \
Choose one boon from the boon list for which you have the required attribute score. Make an action roll against the Challenge Rating equal to 10 + twice the boon’s power level. If your roll equals or exceeds the CR, designate an ally (or yourself) to receive the boon.

Boons typically remain in effect until you cease sustaining them. You may only sustain one boon at a time. If you invoke a boon while you are already sustaining one, the old boon is immediately dispelled.

##### Move Actions
\ \
You can use your **move action** to move up to your maximum speed (30 feet for most PCs). Alternatively you can use your move action to **resist any banes** from which you are suffering. Roll 1d20 for each bane affecting you. On a 10 or higher, the bane is removed.
\
+++

\NextTableColumns{OLT{.37}OLT{.63}}

| **Monkey Bats** (6) | 35’ speed, flying, climbing |
| - | - |
| Hit Points: 5 | Agility 3 (1d8) |
| | Fortitude 1 (1d4) |
| **DEFENSES** | Might 2 (1d6) |
| Toughness: 12 | Perception 2 (1d6) |
| Evasion: 14 | |
| Resolve: 10 | **FAVORED ATTACKS** |
| | **Claws**: Might vs. Evasion, damaging attack |
| | **Push**: Might vs. Evasion, inflicts knockdown bane |
| | **Grapple**: Might vs. Evasion, inflicts immobile bane |

## Adjusting Difficulty

For parties smaller than 5 PCs, reduce the number of monkey bats so that
there is one more monster than PCs. For large groups, add 3 hit points
to the monkey bats’ maximum for each PC beyond the fifth.

## Aftermath

If the party is successful in rescuing the Wapuny, he will be most
grateful. His name is Grik, and he will attempt to convince the party to
return to his village with him to be thanked properly.

Following the battle is also a good time to show the party the map of
*Starfall Island* to help them determine their next course of action.

+++ {.CalloutExample}
##### New Rules Unlocked: Healing
\

At the end of combat, characters who are conscious and take at least ten minutes to rest will regain all of their hit points. Unconscious characters (those at zero hit points) require more time to recuperate, regaining consciousness and all their hit points in 2d4 hours. If an unconscious character receives any healing (such as from the heal boon), he immediately regains consciousness.
+++

## Roleplaying Grik

Because the Wapuny speak a foreign tongue, this initial encounter with
Grik provides a fun opportunity for roleplaying. You can spend as much
or as little time with this as you and your players enjoy.

Use a high pitch, fast, and squeaky voice to speak for Grik - but
because he uses an unknown language, speak in gibberish. Use hand
gestures, or even drawings, to communicate with the players. Make this
encounter come to life by imagining that you really have no idea what
the PCs are saying. Enjoy the challenge of Grik attempting to
communicate both his own name and the name of his people, the Wapuny.
Keep this going for as long as it’s fun, and keep in mind that Grik’s
main goal is to express his thanks and bring the party back to his

##### New Rules Unlocked: Every Roll Matters
\
Action rolls aren’t just used for combat, but for any important action that will drive the story. For this reason, the *every roll matters* rule dictates that any roll **made by players** (not the GM) should be more than a simple pass/fail check.

Most action rolls have a Challenge Rating (CR) to indicate the level of difficulty. When a player’s roll meets or exceeds the CR, then the player succeeds. If a player gets lower than the CR, then the GM chooses to either allow the player to *succeed with a twist* or to *fail, but the story progresses*.

For example, after interacting with Grik for a while, one PC might decide to make a Logic roll to understand the Wapuny language. The CR for this task is 20. If a player gets a 20 on her roll, she can communicate with the Wapuny normally. If she fails the roll, you get to decide what happens.

If you choose for the character to **succeed with a twist**, this could mean that you will only speak to her with very simple words and sentences. If you choose to have the PC **fail, but the story progresses**, this could mean that you continue to speak in gibberish but tell the player that if she spends at least 48 hours interacting with the Wapuny, then she will be able to understand the language on a very simple level.

In a nutshell, *every roll matters* means that dice are never wasted in *Open Legend*. Players should only roll when the story demands it, and the outcome should drive the story forward in one way or another.
+++

## What’s Next?

If the party chooses to travel with Grik, then you can proceed to the
Tree Town Location Encounter. Otherwise, allow the PCs to dictate their
course of action and use the events and encounters throughout the rest
of this book to guide you.

# Locations

## Location A: Tree Town

This encounter takes place at the main village of the Wapuny tribe. They
call it **Glib Nab**, which translates to Tree Town. In this encounter,
the PCs may learn of the war between the two tribes, the curse of the
Big Head, and the Scepter of Kings.

+++ {.CalloutInformation}
*As you cut your way through the thick overgrowth of the jungle, you come upon a buzz of activity in the trees. It appears that a small village of bridges, ziplines, and ladders has been constructed in the trees. Tiny lizard men - no taller than your knee - crawl, swing, and climb through the branches, transporting water, keeping watch, and performing all manner of mundane deeds.*
+++

### Typical Interactions

The items below list important interactions that are likely to happen
between the PCs and the Wapuny.

#### Chief Bik’Bik

\NextTableColumns{OLT{.33}OLT{.67}}

\FloatingTable

| **Chief Bik’Bik** | 25’ speed, climbing |
| - | - |
| Hit Points: 20 | Agility 5 (2d6) |
| | Fortitude 3 (1d8) |
| **DEFENSES** | Might 3 (1d8) |
| Toughness: 14 | Perception 3 (1d8) |
| Evasion: 16 | Perception 3 (1d8) |
| Resolve: 18 | Will 4 (1d10) |
| | Persuasion 3 (1d8) |
| | Presence 4 (1d10) |
| | **FAVORED ATTACKS** |
| | **Blowgun** (range 30’): Agility vs. Evasion, damaging attack \ If target takes at least one damage, also inflicts slow. |
| | **Wooden spear**: Might vs. Evasion, damaging attack |

The Wapuny chief is a tall(er) warrior named Bik’Bik (or Big Big, so
named for his massive 2’3” stature). He wears a fancy hat crafted from
the fur and flesh of a monkey bat, and he frequently tosses his tail
from one shoulder to the next in a grand gesture (This is to constantly
remind his people  \  \
\ \ \
 of the monkey bat he once slew in single combat). He
also wields a long stick topped with a roughly cut pink star crystal.
His kingly rod doubles as a blowgun (the favored weapon of his people),
and he raises it high whenever he needs the silence or attention of his
subjects.

Bik’Bik’s reaction to the party depends entirely upon their first
impression. If they come after having rescued Grik, he will be impressed
with their power and seek to make allies of them against the Wapungo. As
thanks for aiding one of his subjects, Bik’Bik will even reward the
party with a vial of Slug Juice, the Wapuny’s signature poison (and the
only reason they stand a chance against the Wapungo).

+++ {.CalloutExample}

##### Slug Juice
\ \
This Wapuny poison isn’t actually made from slugs, but a rare flower found in the deep parts of the jungle. The name comes from the effect of the poison: a debilitating sluggishness.

A weapon coated with a dose of Slug Juice automatically applies the slow bane to the first target it hits for at least one point of damage.

A vial of slug juice contains 3 doses.

+++

#### The War with No Beginning

The party may learn of the War with No Beginning, as the Wapuny call
their conflict with the Wapungo on account of no one remembering when
the war started. The Wapuny claim that they have proper rights to the
Great Star because it fell on their capital city in ages past. The
beautiful crystals are a just payment for the lives taken, and the
heavens have obviously gifted the precious star to them for a reason.

#### The Curse of the Big Head

If the PCs befriend the Wapuny, the lizard folk will warn the party of
the Big Head that guards the north east peninsula. They say that the
massive demonic statuary sprang into existence about five years ago.
None of them have dared to go near it, but any who have travelled beyond
the Big Head have never returned.

#### The Dragon’s Maw

An old, stooped-over Wapuny wearing shamanic garb will share with the
party the ancient prophecy about this dormant volcano: “When a king lays
claim to Starfall Island, the Dragon will spit flame once again.”

#### The Scepter of Kings

The Wapuny can also tell the party of the ancient city to the east. They
call it Bik Nab (or Big Town). They say that the city is even older than
the War with No Beginning, and that it once belonged to gods who walked
the earth. The wall on the outside is carved with images that tell a
story of a great staff known as the Scepter of Kings. Any that wield
this staff will be have great power in commanding their people.

Chief Bik’Bik believes that if he possessed the scepter, he could lead
his people to wipe out the evil Wapungos once and for all. However, the
Wapunies do not dare enter within the walls of Bik Nab, for legend tells
that it is still home to the gods who created this island and its
people, and that any of their creatures who lay eyes upon the gods will
be struck stone for all eternity. For this reason, the chief will ask
the PCs to retrieve the Scepter for him. If he knows they are looking
for a way off the island, he will promise the assistance of his shamans,
who know the ways of the winds and will be able to predict a good hour
for them to set sail (assuming they acquire a ship somehow).

## Location B: Ancient Ruins


The ancient ruins that lie at the southeast of the island are known as
Bik Nab to the locals, translating as Big Town. The city that once stood
here is five hundred years old and belonged to a race of serpentine
warlocks called the Izzaru who used the island as a sort of magical
laboratory, experimenting on the local natives and wildlife. It is for
this reason that the Wapunies and Wapungos believe this to be a city of
their creators - for in a way it is. Through arcane experiments, the
Izzaru gave lizards intelligence, thus creating the Wapuny, who became
their house slaves. And through selective breeding of humans, the
warlocks created the Wapungos to serve as laborers. The Izzaru are also
responsible for the monkey bats and other strange monstrosities found
throughout Starfall Island.

The Izzaru fell to destruction due to infighting. Two leaders vied for
kingship, lines were drawn in the sand, and a great battle of sorcery
left the city in ruins.

+++ {.CalloutInformation}
*A massive and ancient stone wall stands before you, barring entry to what can only be a city lying within. The wall stretches for miles, and at its center is a pair of heavy stone doors, sealed shut. Whatever ingenious mechanics or force of magic allows such doors to swing is beyond your knowledge.*

*The wall is carved from head to toe with pictograms that tell many stories. Large serpentine humans - man on top with snake-like bodies - are depicted performing epic deeds of sorcery. They cause the sun to rise and fall, jungles to grow, and tides to turn. The serpent creatures also rule over two other races. One is human yet uniformly large in stature. From what you can tell, these poor brutes are slave laborers to the sorcerous snakes. The other, short lizards who walk upright, are shown serving around the great halls and houses of the snakemen.*

*One scene that is depicted quite frequently involves a serpent man regally cloaked and crowned in jewels. He stands atop a massive ziggurat and wields a great scepter that bears the head of a cobra. The cobra’s eyes are carved inlets wherever this scene appears, as though the city wall was once bedecked with gems - though they have long since been pilfered. Standing before the snake king are his subjects, who gaze upon their leader with fervor and loyalty.*
+++

Forcing the door open is almost impossible, requiring a character of at
least Might 5 to make an action roll against a Challenge Rating of 25,
or similar results with a different attribute combined with a good
story. The most likely means of entrance is to scale the wall. If the
party can acquire rope and grappling hooks (perhaps from the wreckage),
the climb will be easy enough for them. A character attempting to scale
the wall without rope will need to succeed at a Might check, CR 15
(remember that *every roll matters*).

Once inside the walls (or on top of them) the party can make out a vast
city lying in ruins. Buildings are crumbled and inner walls toppled. A
few pillars still stand tall, supporting nothing but the open sky. At
the far south, several miles away, the PCs can spot a ziggurat of some
sort that still stands in tact, though it is separated from the rest of
the city by a rope bridge.

### Navigating the Ruins

As the party makes their way through the ruins of Bik Nab, they become
the prey of the only survivor of the cataclysm: a golem made of stone
who once served as guardian to a powerful sorcerer. Since the fall of
the Izzaru, the golem has sat dormant. Alerted by the party’s presence,
he reverts to his master’s last orders: “Crush anyone you see!”

The golem lies amidst the rubble, almost completely unrecognizable. The
party will pass by it a little over halfway through the the city as they
trek towards the ziggurat. Choose one character to make a Perception
roll, CR 15. This could be the PC with the keenest senses, the one at
the front of the marching order, or the player who specifically mentions
that he is keeping a wary eye. If the PC succeeds at the roll, he
notices the rubble moving from about 100 feet away.

If he fails the roll, remember your options: either he succeeds with a
twist, or he fails but the story progresses. Perhaps the PC wanders from
the rest of the party and notices the golem when he is already standing
on top of it.

Read the following description when the golem finally rears its ugly
head:

+++ {.CalloutInformation}
Unfolding itself before you from the rubble is a colossal giant made of stone. It blended in almost perfectly with the ruins of this once great city, but now it is hidden no longer. Towering some twenty feet high, the massive collection of boulders moves with unexpected ease. Set in its carved forehead is a large gem, glowing with a crimson magical light. The brute’s eyes are sharp fires of the same color, and they glare at you with malice as the golem lets out a shout of war that shakes the city walls. He stoops over slightly, picks up a boulder three times the size of the largest of you, and crushes it to dust in his bare hands.
+++

### Fight or Flight

The golem will not stop until the party is crushed to a pulp. He stands
20 feet tall and is as hard to bring down as a city wall. If the party
chooses to fight, their one chance lies in removing the golem’s control
gem, which rests in the center of his head. Reaching the gem might
require some ingenuity on the players’ part. If they can manage, though,
they can attempt to either remove the gem or destroy it. Destroying the
gem requires 10 points of damage from a weapon with the *forceful*
property or another attack that targets toughness and could
realistically damage a gem. The gem’s toughness is 15. Removing the gem
requires an Agility test against CR 20.

\NextTableColumns{OLT{.33}OLT{.67}}

\FloatingTable

| **Stone Golem** | 40’ speed |
| - | - |
| Hit Points: 50 | Agility 3 (1d8) |
| | Fortitude 7 (2d10) |
| **DEFENSES** | Might 6 (2d8) |
| Toughness: 21 | Perception 3 (1d8) |
| Evasion: 24 | |
| Resolve: 15 | **FAVORED ATTACKS** |
| **Special**: Attacks from precise weapons deal half damage to stone golem. | **Slam**: Might vs. Evasion, damaging attack <br /> If attack deals 1+ damage, it also inflicts forced move 15’ |
| | **Hurl Rock** (range 45’): Agility vs. Evasion, damaging attack <br /> If attacks deals 1+ damage, it also inflicts knockdown |


If the party chooses to fly, an epic chase scene ensues. Use the rubble
of the city to provide an exciting backdrop for the chase. Describe the
characters being divided on opposite sides of a wall, running atop a
fallen column, leaping from one crumbling roof to the next, and finding
moments to hide momentarily. Narrate the golem punching through walls,
lifting buildings, and hurling pillars.

Don’t feel the need to break the chase scene down into increments of 30’
of movement. Rather than thinking of the scene in terms of rounds, break
it into “cuts”, like in a movie. The camera cuts from one action-packed
moment to the next. Instead of rolling initiative and taking turns,
describe the setting, tell the party what the golem is doing, and let
them react. When appropriate, let them make action rolls, but remember
that *every roll matters*.

The perfect place to end the chase scene is at the rope bridge to the
south, where the golem is too heavy to pursue. The party is already more
than half way through the city, so turning back would be a long run. And
scaling the walls to escape will be almost impossible while the golem is
still giving chase.

### The Ziggurat of Kings

Standing atop an isolated plateau to the south of the city is the
Ziggurat of Kings, once the Temple and Throne to Izzaru Royalty. There
are two primary ways by which the PCs might approach the ziggurat,
either by the rope bridge leading from the city or by scaling the cliff.

Scaling the cliff is arduous and difficult. With proper equipment, it
takes about four hours and requires a Might roll, CR 15. Characters who
fail this roll might suffer one level of the Fatigue bane, and become
physically shaken, unable to complete the climb and forced to take the
bridge or rest and try again.

### Arachnid Attack

Whether the party chooses to cross the bridge or scale the mountain,
they will be attacked by a pack of giant arachnids specially bred by the
Izzaru for defense of this plateau. The creatures are spider-like, but
have bony protrusions extending from their front legs which serve as
blades in combat.

Whether this fight happens on the cliffs or the bridge, make it epic by
capitalizing on the arachnids’ adept climbing ability. They crawl
beneath the bridge or along the cliff face to outmaneuver foes. You can
also make use of the knockdown bane in order to create moments of
tension. If a spider succeeds at a knockdown attack, the targeted player
is now hanging from the cliff or rope bridge. A subsequent knockdown
attack would send them hurtling to their doom (so use with restraint).

\NextTableColumns{OLT{.33}OLT{.67}}

| **Twisted Arachnids** (4) | 30’ speed, climbing |
| - | - |
| Hit Points: 10 | Agility 4 (1d10) |
| | Fortitude 3 (1d8) |
| **DEFENSES** | Might 3 (1d8) |
| Toughness: 13 | Perception 2 (1d6) |
| Evasion: 14 | |
| Resolve: 12 | **FAVORED ATTACKS** |
| | **Blades**: Agility vs. Evasion, damaging attack |
| | **Fangs**: Might vs. Evasion, damaging attack  |
| | **Poison**: If the fang attack deals at least 5 damage, the target also suffers the stun bane. |
| | **Trip**: Might vs. Evasion, inflict knockdown. |

### Adjusting Difficulty

For parties smaller than five, adjust the number of arachnids so that
there is one less than the number of PCs. For very large parties, do not
use more than 6 arachnids, instead increasing their maximum hit points
by 3 for each additional PC beyond the 7th.

+++ {.CalloutExample}
##### New Rules Unlocked: Multi-targeting and Complete Advantage/Disadvantage
\ \
These rules are best introduced to your players during their second combat involving more than one foe. The arachnid combat is a perfect example of when players could make use of multi-targeting.

##### Advantage & Disadvantage
\ \
If multiple circumstances are affecting a character trying to make an action roll, or if the situation is exceptionally modified by outside forces, an action can accrue multiple levels of advantage or disadvantage. This is expressed by a number, such as advantage 2 or disadvantage 3.

When making a roll with advantage or disadvantage, you roll an extra number of attribute dice equal to the advantage or disadvantage level. **If the action has advantage**, you then remove the *lowest* X dice, in which X is the advantage level. **If the action has disadvantage**, you remove the *highest* X dice.
+++

\newpage

+++ {.CalloutExample}
##### Multi-targeting
\ \
When you make a damaging attack, inflict a bane, or invoke a boon, you may choose to target more than one foe at the cost of suffering disadvantage, as explained below.

For **melee attacks**, you may attack as many foes of your choice that are within your reach. You suffer disadvantage equal to the number of targets.

For **ranged attacks**, you may target up to 5 foes who are within 25’ of each other. You suffer disadvantage equal to the number of targets.

For **area attacks** (such as a fireball), designate the length of the square you would like to target. For each 5’ of length, you suffer one level of disadvantage (10’ square = disadvantage 2, 15’ square = disadvantage 3, etc.)

Note also that area attacks target your foe’s Toughness.
+++


### An Ancient Curse

As the party approaches the Ziggurat of Kings read the following:

+++ {.CalloutInformation}
*The structure standing before you is formed in three levels, each reaching about 20’ in height and composed of countless blocks of stone. A long staircase extends up one side of the ziggurat to the highest level, which appears to form a small building. Decorating the staircase and the surrounding levels of the temple are dozens upon dozens of lifelike statues. They all take the form of some type of humanoid creature: some are short pygmy lizards, others tall and strong humans, and still others are snakefolk, with the top form of a human and long snake bodies from the waist down. All of the statues share a common trait: they are posed with looks and postures of terror.*

*A single stone door bars entrance to the building at the top of the stairs. Engraved upon it are more pictograms like those on the city wall. In these scenes, however, you see the serpentine staff being held before a tall mountain spewing with smoke and fire.*
+++

The door is heavy and stuck with age, but it doesn’t require exceptional
strength to open, just a good dose of elbow grease. It is, however,
trapped. A character inspecting the door for traps or other oddities can
make a Perception roll, CR 15, to notice that above the door is a secret
compartment which is meant to spill something upon intruders when the
door is opened. With this knowledge, PCs can attempt opening the door
from a distance, perhaps with a fastened rope or telekinesis if anyone
is trained in the Movement attribute.

Upon opening the door, a mass of rocks pours down upon anyone under or
adjacent to the door. Make an attack roll for the door as if it had a
might score of 3 (1d20 + 1d8) against the targets’ Evasion defense. All
damage dealt by the trap is **lethal** **damage.**

+++ {.CalloutExample}
##### New Rule Unlocked: Lethal Damage
Whenever you roll a natural 20 on the d20 used in a damaging attack roll, your attack inflicts some lethal damage. The amount of lethal damage is equal to the total of subsequent d20 rolls for that attack (i.e., the d20 explosion total). Other attack sources, such as traps, can also inflict lethal damage without rolling a natural 20.

A creature’s maximum hit points are reduced by the amount of lethal damage it suffers.

Lethal damage is more difficult to heal then regular damage, healing at a rate of 1 hit point per day per Fortitude attribute point (minimum of 1 hit point).  With the full-time attendance of a capable healer, any number of characters who are located in the same area and avoid strenuous activity heal at an additional rate equal to their attendant’s Creation, Presence, or Learning score.  Multiple attendants do not cumulatively improve this accelerated healing rate (the bonus is simply equal to the highest score among attendants). For example, a warrior with Fortitude 4 heals 4 lethal damage per day on his own. With the assistance of a physician with a learning score of 8, the same warrior would heal at a rate of 12 lethal damage per day.
+++

Upon entering the Ziggurat chamber, read the following.

+++ {.CalloutInformation}
*A smell of dust and death overcomes your senses as you enter the shadowy chamber. This place is ancient, and you soon discover that it has long been someone’s tomb. The area within is small, perhaps about twenty feet square, and it forms two chambers.*

*Just within the doorway is a small foyer, where the path is flanked by large alcoves shelved with all manner of royal and priestly sundries - decaying robes, rusted holy symbols, jarred components for arcane rituals. Deeper within, you cannot make out much from the minimal amount of light seeping into the ziggurat, but you can see that second room holds a throne with a cloaked figure sitting quietly upon it. Resting in the figure’s arms is something that reflects rays of faint purple light, and lying at the foot of the throne are the skeletal remains of some sort of humanoid creature.*
+++

Investigating further, the party discovers the skeletal remains are
those of one of the Izzaru, with a human form on top and a great coiling
snakes tail from the waist down. A **dagger, unblemished by time**, is
lodged in the creature’s spine.

Now that the party has a better view, they see that the figure resting
on the throne is dead, though far less decomposed than would be
expected. It is another Izzaru, dressed in priestly robes, and still
bearing flesh, which is stretched thin and decayed. In its arms is the
Scepter of Kings, a short, golden rod with the head of a cobra bearing
eyes of violet gems.

Before the party has time to speculate as to whether or not this
creature is undead, it speaks.

### The High Priest’s Final Hope

Five hundred years ago, as the great battle of sorcery swept throughout
the city, and eldritch spells of nuclear proportion were being woven by
the power-hungry Izzaru warlocks, the high priest Serathikis foresaw the
city’s impending doom. In a last attempt to save his people, he ushered
the king, Taalssix the Thirteenth, into the ziggurat in guise of
attempting to protect him. With the king’s guard down, the high priest
stabbed him from behind, offering Taalssix’s royal blood to his dark god
in a desperate attempt to gain some form of divine intervention to save
his race.

Unfortunately, his god was not pleased with Serathikis’s offering. The
serpent god intervened, for certain, but not to save the city. In a
showing of great rage he cursed the high priest, saying that it was
betrayal that had doomed the Izzaru in the first place, and that another
act of betrayal could not save them. Serathikis has been cursed for five
hundred years to sit in this throne room and guard the Scepter of Kings
in atonement for turning traitor on royal blood. His spirit will only be
free once the Scepter has left his hands.

### Roleplaying Serathikis

The first words out of the high priest’s mouth are “For long have I
awaited thee, who seek the Scepter of Kings. Ask me but three questions,
and then the staff shall be yours, though when my spirit departs, your
trial will begin.”

From there, converse with the PCs as Serathikis. He is a snake man, so
speak with long hisses and drawling whispers. Keep in mind also that he
has sat in the same place for five centuries - so he is quite mad.

His curse requires him to answer three questions honestly of any who
ask, and then relinquish the scepter peacefully, at which point his
spirit departs this world and his body slumps limply to the ground.

Serathikis retains only the knowledge he had in life, so he can tell the
party nothing of the goings on in the island today. He does not know of
the starfall or the necromancer. Nor is he permitted to say anything of
the trial that he mentioned. He can tell of his people, how they fell,
his curse, the origin of the Wapuny and Wapungo.

+++ {.CalloutExample}

##### New Rules Unlocked: Minor Actions, Boss Actions, and Exceptional Success

##### Minor Actions
\ \
In addition to one normal action and one movement action, combatants are also allowed any number of minor actions, which include tasks such as drawing a weapon, sheathing a weapon, sustaining a boon, making a Learning roll to recall useful information, and making an opportunity attack. **You may not take the same type of minor action more than once in any round**.

##### Sustain a Boon
\ \
If you have a boon in effect and do not sustain it, the boon ends when your turn is over. Because sustaining a boon is a minor action, you can normally only sustain one boon at a time.

##### Opportunity Attacks
\ \
An opportunity attack is a special kind of minor action because it does not take place during your turn. If you are wielding a melee weapon, and an enemy moves from a space within your reach to a space that is not within your reach, you may make a free attack against the enemy. (Note that, as a minor action, you may only make one opportunity attack per round).

##### Boss Actions
\ \
Some monsters or villains are so formidable in combat that they are able to take multiple actions throughout the round, thereby proving challenging enough to take on an entire party alone. These “boss monsters” gain access to a certain number of boss actions.

If a monster has boss actions, make an extra number of initiative rolls for each boss action. When arranging the initiative order, there must be at least one PC between each of the boss’s turns. If necessary, move the “boss action” turns lower in the order to accommodate this requirement.

During combat, the highest initiative count indicates the boss’s normal turn, during which it gets the usual allotment of normal, move, and minor actions. Each of the boss’s lower counts in the initiative are boss actions, which allow the boss to make one normal action.

##### Exceptional Success
\ \
When you make a damaging attack and roll exceptionally well, you may also be able to inflict a bane for free.

If your attack roll exceeds the target’s defense by 10 or more, you may apply one bane of a Power Level less than or equal to the attribute you used for the attack. In order to apply a bane, your attack roll must equal or exceed the appropriate defense for that bane. If your attack targeted multiple foes, you may apply the bane to each qualifying target.
+++

### The Trial of Kings

Those who would wield the Scepter of Kings must prove their royal blood.
An interesting fact about the royal bloodline of the Izzaru is that they
are completely immune to petrification, and so the test devised by this
people involves staring into the eyes of a basilisk. As soon as the
party obtains the scepter, the basilisk, which hibernates in a secret
lair in the roof of the ziggurat, slithers out and secretly enters
through the door to attack the party.

The basilisk is a serpentine creature about 30’ in length. In combat, it
strikes quickly, targeting slow, unarmored foes with its fang attacks,
attempting to poison as many as possible. If anyone is affected by its
gaze attack, the basilisk will ignore them in favor of more threatening
foes. The the basilisk can use its mind dredge ability for free on one
target each round, allowing it to read their minds if successful. It
will use this ability to learn the party’s strategy and react
accordingly.

The basilisk is magically bound to the ziggurat, and it will not pursue
enemies beyond the bottom step.

### Adjusting Difficulty

For groups smaller than 5, the basilisk does not receive any boss
actions. For groups larger than 5, the basilisk receives 10 extra hit
points per extra PC. If the group consists of 8 or more PCs, the
basilisk has 2 boss actions instead of 1.

\NextTableColumns{OLT{.33}OLT{.67}}

### Aftermath

If the characters are successful in retrieving the Scepter of Kings, the
next step for them is to decide what to do with it. The necromancer,
Thorn, has kept close watch on the ruined city using divination, and he
will soon learn of the party’s exploits. If you have not used it yet,
during the next time the PCs make camp, you can run the event encounter
*The Dream Speaker*, in which Asha appears to one of the party members.

Characters who are averting their eyes incur the *blinded* bane. |

##### *Betrayal* (dagger)
\ \
The dagger which the high priest used to murder his king has become imbued with magical power as a result of the twisted nature of its history. It is named *Betrayal* and possesses the following traits:
- A character possessing *Betrayal* gains advantage 1 on all Deception rolls.
- When used to attack an unaware target from behind, *Betrayal* grants advantage 2 on the attack roll.

##### Scepter of Kings
\ \
This kingly rod is crafted of gold and bears the shape of a cobra with purple gems set in its eyes. The scepter had been passed from one Izzaru king to the next as a means of ensuring the strength of the royal bloodline at defending the throne. It is heavily imbued with ancient magics and grants the wielder the following powers:

- The wielder gains advantage 2 on all presence and persuasion rolls.

- The wielder chooses one attribute that is primary to his power and ability (a warrior would likely choose Might, for example, and a necromancer Entropy). Whenever making action tests using the chosen attribute, the wielder’s attribute dice explode whenever they roll maximum and whenever they roll a 1.

- If the wielder leads a force in combat, the entire force (even an entire army) is inspired and gains advantage 1 on all attack rolls.

The scepter’s power to inspire allies is why it will turn the tide of the war between the Wapungo and the Wapuny. For a hundred years, the two forces have remained relatively equal. With the scepter on either side, the other will fall quickly if not empowered by some other source.

**The Prophecy of the Dragon**
The Scepter of Kings is also the answer to an ancient prophecy passed down from the days of the ruin of the city - a prophecy that Wapungo and Wapuny alike still repeat: “When a king lays claim to Starfall Island, the Dragon will spit flame once again.”

This scepter possesses the power to summon lava from the Dragon’s Maw, though the wielder does not know this. However, after owning the staff for a few hours, the wielder will begin to feel an unending urge to visit the volcano. For more on the role of the Scepter of Kings in awakening the volcano, see *Location H: The Dragon’s Maw*.

+++ {.CalloutExample}
##### New Rules Unlocked: Leveling Up
After the party’s first major success, you can allow them to level up and gain access to feats, special abilities which help define their character. Retrieving the scepter of kings is one good milestone worthy of gaining a level, though others may occur first depending on the decisions your players make. You should allow players to level up twice during this adventure.

##### New Attribute Points
Upon leveling up, you gain 9 new attribute points to spend. You can use these to increase your current attributes or buy completely new ones. The maximum attribute score you can reach in this adventure is 5. You do not have to use all of your attribute points at once, and any remaining attribute points can be saved for use at future levels.

The cost to increase an attribute is equal to the new score. So, for example, to raise your Might from 3 to 4 would cost 4 attribute points. You must make these increases one step at a time, so to raise a score from
\ \
\ \
0 to 2 would cost 3 attribute points total.

##### New Hit Points
In *Open Legend*, attributes are the means by which your hit points increase. If you want your character to be able to take more hits, increase your Fortitude, Presence, or Will attributes. As outlined in the default hit point formula, you’ll gain 2 hit points each time you raise one of those attributes by one.

##### New Feats
Feats unlock new abilities for characters or empower their current ones. Upon gaining access to feats in this adventure, each player may select two feats from the feat list at the end of this book. When the PCs reach 3rd level, they may choose one additional feat.

## Location C: The Big Head

When the party approaches the Big Head (as the Wapuny call it) that lies
northeast of the ruined city, read the following flavor text:

+++ {.CalloutInformation}
*In the distance, you can make out what looks to be a large statue of a head standing ominously on the shore. As you approach closer, it is clear that the statue is not carved of stone at all, but constructed of all manner of bones. Sharp brows, curved horns, and sinister eyes reveal that this ungodly work of art was made not in the image of man, but of a demon.*
+++

Five years ago, after Thorn had made his pact with Asgaroth, he needed
to leave his wife’s burial ground at the edge of the peninsula in order
to take up residence in the Dragon’s Maw. But he couldn’t bear the
thought of any natives or creatures desecrating Asha’s remains, and so
he used his twisted magics to hunt down wildlife and craft this likeness
of Asgaroth from their bones. He eradicated all of the fauna within a
half mile of the statue, and those that he did not use in his sculpture,
he scattered in the narrow region of the northeast peninsula, cursing
them to guard his wife. Even today, the area surrounding the head is
eerily devoid of animal life. Not even a cricket chirps.

Over the years, as more and more of the inhabitants of Starfall Island
met their demise to Thorn’s undead minions on the peninsula, the head
became a landmark for man and beast alike to avoid the area.

Inspecting the statue doesn’t reveal anything of particular note to the
party. This scene serves mainly to foreshadow different aspects of the
adventure.


## Location D: Asha’s Grave

The far shore of the northeast peninsula was the site of Thorn’s
shipwreck, and that is where he buried his wife, vowing to return one
day with the power to raise her from the dead. Before the party can
reach the site, though, they must overcome the necromancer’s undead
guardians.

### A Fell Wind

As the party travels through the narrowest region of the peninsula, read
the following:

+++ {.CalloutInformation}
*The peninsula narrows here to about 300 feet wide. The sound of flanking waves slowly crashing on the shore combines with the light breeze whispering across your face to almost soothe the nerves that are still on edge from the sight of that ghastly demonic statue. The breeze picks up though, at first just a strong wind and then a gale of hurricane strength. The squall is brief but powerful, kicking sand into the air like a child shaking a snow globe. For a moment, you are completely blinded, and then the wind calms. When you regain your sight, the landscape has transformed. The surface level of the sand having been disturbed,you can see the ground littered in all directions with bones. And they move.*
+++

For about 150 feet in all directions, the party is surrounded by animal
bones that animate into all manner of sinister shapes. Some look like
monkeys, some parrots, others panthers, and still others take the form
of demonic beasts unknown to this world.

At the start of combat, there are two undead guardians for each PC. At
the end of every round, another one for each PC will take form and join
the fray. They will continue to form until a total equal to the party
size times 6 is reached. If the party leaves the 150’ radius circle of
bones, the existing skeletons will pursue them, but new guardians will
cease to form.


\NextTableColumns{OLT{.33}OLT{.67}}

| **Skeletal Guardians** | 30’ speed |
| - | - |
| Hit Points: 1 | Agility 1 (1d6) |
| | Fortitude 1 (1d4) |
| **DEFENSES** | Might 1 (1d4) |

| Resolve: 10 | **FAVORED ATTACKS** |
| | **Claws, bite, etc**: Might vs. Evasion, damaging attack |
| | **Horde Intimidation**: Entropy vs. Resolve = demoralized bane |


### The Burial Site

With the skeletons taken care of or evaded, the party can access the end
of the peninsula:

+++ {.CalloutInformation}
*Upon reaching the tip of the peninsula you immediately learn that you are not the first unfortunate souls to have been marooned on this accursed island. Scattered about a small patch of shore is the evidence of another shipwreck. Broken crates and barrels litter the sand, and one large chunk of the ship’s helm reveals that it was a vessel of moderate size.*

*Of particular note is what appears to be a small burial mound erected far from the water. A mound of stones, piled low in the shape of a grave, is ornamented with a small bunch of jungle flowers, relatively fresh. Carved on a piece of flotsam used as a grave marker is a single name: Asha. According to the dating, Asha died at the young age of 23 sometime five years ago.*

*Beside the flowers, weighed down by a large stone, is a small wooden box.*
+++

If the players open the box, they find within a folded piece of
parchment and a simple golden ring. Unfolding the parchment, they
discover the following note:

+++ {.CalloutInformation}
*My beloved Asha,*

*I leave you now with a heavy heart, but hopeful. When I discovered you amidst the wreckage, I was crestfallen, and oft considered abandoning this earthly coil to be with you again - better than rotting with whatever savage beasts infest this vile island. But I will not forsake my vow to you. When I knelt before you and slipped this ring upon your finger, I promised you a new life in a new land - and you shall have it.*

*My nights have been sleepless since losing you, and in the dark hours of the night, I have discovered that great power lies within this damnable island, waiting to be tapped. I leave you now in search of this power.*

*I leave your ring here, lest you lose it in your sleep. One day, I shall return to kneel before you once again and place it upon your finger, and we shall have our new life.*

*Your faithful husband,*
*Eric*
+++


##### Asha’s Ring
Anyone attempting to put Asha’s wedding band on will discover that it resizes to fit their finger. However, it cannot be removed unless the wearer or Eric Thorn is killed. The ring grants some power but also bears a curse.

- A character wearing Asha’s ring is shielded by powerful magics, gaining +1 to all defenses.

- The wearer, however, also falls under the gaze of the necromancer. Thorn can scry upon the wearer at any time, seeing and hearing his surroundings.

### Development

The information learned at Asha’s grave site might lead the party to any
number of decisions, depending upon their prior knowledge. One
particular outcome worth expecting is that the PCs may decide to wait
for Thorn to return and place flowers upon the grave once again.

If they do make this decision, the necromancer revisits Asha about once
a month, around the full moon. There is little chance of the party
laying ambush for Thorn here, as the beach is wide open with no terrain
to provide cover in the immediate vicinity. Thorn may also expect the
party’s presence if they disturbed his skeleton trap, in which case he
comes armed with a retinue of undead servants. This scene could make for
a final battle between the necromancer and the party, but it might also
provide an interesting moment of parley between the two forces, in which
Thorn attempts to make a deal to retrieve what he needs from the PCs
(Asha’s ring, the Scepter of Kings, their allegiance, etc.). It’s
important to note that Thorn will give almost anything to retrieve his
wife’s ring, as long as he believes that his sacrifice will not cost him
the chance to one day bring her back.


## Location E: The Great Chasm

At the center of Starfall Island is a massive crater left by Asgaroth’s
meteor which struck the earth some hundred years ago. As the
party approaches, read the following:

+++ {.CalloutInformation}
*The island here is devoid of jungle for miles around, giving way to a barren badlands of dry, cracked earth completely unnatural for the clime and location. Far within the badlands is a massive chasm that extends deep into the earth and stretches on for miles. As you travel throughout this strange terrain, you find signs of battle everywhere.*

*Weapons lay discarded - blowguns, spears, crude stone daggers, and tomahawks. The remains of warriors abandoned in death can be found regularly, in various states of decay. Some are bones that look decades old, others are fresh - perhaps killed a week ago. The dead reveal two sides to this war that has been long raging: one a short race of pygmy lizard folk who stand knee high; the other a tall, barrel-chested race of mighty humans.*

*Drawing close to the crater, you can see a faint pink glow emanating from the darkness about half a mile below. Natural staircases of rough stone ledges circle the sides of the cliff, predicting a long, but not arduous, descent.*
+++

If you have not already used it, this location could be the perfect
setting for the Drawing a Line event encounter, in which the party
witnesses a skirmish between the Wapuny and the Wapungo.

Alternatively, if the PCs have already made some progress in the
adventure, this could be a good place to use the Mining Expedition event
encounter, which hints at the slackening of the Wapungo raids and the
first stage of the necromancer's scheme unfolding.

### Descent into Darkness

The party can reach the bottom of the chasm in a matter of hours without
much difficulty, though if your players seem to be demanding some
action, the winding stony ledges of the crater would make an exciting
location for an attack by a swarm of monkey bats.

As the party continues their descent, they begin to feel an unexpected
inner excitement. The shining of the pink jewels below grows brighter,
and with it grows the adventurers’ energy. Rather than suffering fatigue
from their climb, they become emboldened and energized by the prospects
of great wealth and the power that comes with it.

Reaching the bottom, the party discovers the Great Star - a colossal
pink gem the size of a small house and emanating with arcane light. At
this point, the greed and malice inspired by Asgaroth’s presence takes
hold over some of the PCs, enthralling them to attack their brethren
against their will.

Choose half of the party to be affected by this domination. One way to
choose is by picking the party members with the lowest Resolve defense.
Alternatively, if any of the roleplaying up to this point has divided
the party on some grounds, that may also help determine who is affected.
Character backgrounds should also be taken into consideration. A dwarven
rogue who has already expressed a lust for gems, for example, should
probably be affected.

Once you've chosen the dominated characters, read the following text.

+++ {.CalloutInformation}
*Upon reaching the floor of the great chasm, the dreams of wealth that danced in your head during the long descent are enflamed by the sight of the largest gem you have ever seen. The size of a small cottage and glowing with an arcane light, this pink jewel could purchase a small kingdom.*

*Your eyes dart among your companions, and you can see the malice in their eyes. They want the wealth for themselves, and they will stop at nothing to get it. You thought they were your allies, but no. See, now, they draw blade and weave spell against you. It is a hard choice, but the only one you have - you must defend yourself.*
+++

Have the party roll initiative and fight one another. The dominated
characters should retain full control over choosing their actions, but
must obviously roleplay according to their new dispositions.

Characters can be freed from the domination effect by a number of means.
Allow room for player ingenuity, but also consider the following
possibilities:

-   A character knocked unconscious (zero hit points) will be freed upon
    regaining consciousness.

-   A character can be freed from domination if an ally makes a Presence
    or Persuasion roll against the target’s Resolve.

-   The Enchantment or Abjuration attributes can be used to weave a
    counterspell if the action roll equals or exceeds the dominated
    target’s Resolve.

### Aftermath

Depending on the outcome of this battle, the story could take many
directions. If the dominated PCs win, they probably won't kill their
allies. Once the other half of the party is unconscious, they will begin
hammering away at the gem with whatever means possible. And scale back
up the cliff to hide their reward. From there, take the story where you
want it.

Perhaps the Wapunies find the PCs with bags of star crystals and declare
them traitorous enemies and Wapungo friends. Perhaps Thorn uses their
dominated state as leverage to get what he wants from the party.


## Location F: The Wapungo Camp

At the southwest edge of the island, alongside a canyon cut into its
side, lies the territory of the Wapungo. They are a tall folk, standing
six feet on average, and their people are uncommonly strong for humans.
Accentuating the Wapungo’s impressive stature is a form of bodily
decoration that strikes fear in the hearts of their foes. They are known
to adorn their faces with piercings of animal bones in order to look
more monstrous than human. For example, many will drive warthog tusks
through their lower lips in order to appear to have tusks of their own.
Others will give themselves horns or spikes.

The Wapungo camps are traditional, made up of collections of tents.
Preferring open combat, and wary of the Wapunies’ stealth, they make a
habit of heavily clearing the surrounding jungles and installing bone
chime alarms to announce the presence of enemies.

The Wapungo language is very similar to that of the Wapuny, but they
speak in large, slow, guttural voices. The party will be able to
comprehend their tongue to the same extent that they can understand the
Wapunies.

### Potential Interactions

The following interactions describe some of the likely events and
encounters that the players will experience at the Wapungo camp.

### Friend or Foe?

If the Wapungo have not had any interaction with the PCs yet, their
motives will be immediately questioned. If they aren't taking
precautions to be stealthy, they will be discovered by four Wapungo
warriors a little ways outside of camp, who will attempt to get the PCs
to lay down arms and see their chief. The warriors will not instigate
combat unless threatened. Brave as they are, the Wapungo are very
cautious around the foreign looking adventurers and their strange arms
and armor. If the party refuses to come, the Wapungos will insist that
they leave the area.

### A War of Honor

According to Wapungo tradition, they were the first to discover the
Great Star. They claim that the star fell upon the Wapuny village as a
punishment from the gods, and that a Wapungo chief led the first
expedition to mine the crystal. They intended to share the wealth with
the Wapunies, but on their climb back up the chasm, the Wapungos were
ambushed by the nefarious lizards. Since then, as a matter of honor and
revenge, the Wapungo have laid claim to the star, refusing to surrender
a single gem to the treacherous Wapuny.

### Chief Bloodfist

\NextTableColumns{OLT{.33}OLT{.67}}

\FloatingTable

| **Chief Bloodfist** | 30’ speed |
| - | - |
| Hit Points: 40 | Agility 4 (1d10) |
| | Fortitude 5 (2d6) |
| **DEFENSES** | Might 6 (2d8) |
| Toughness: 14 | Perception 3 (1d8) |
| Evasion: 15 | Will 3 (1d6) |
| Resolve: 16 | Presence 3 (1d6) |

| | Fists: Might vs. Evasion, damaging attack <br /> If attack deals at least 1 damage, target also suffers knockdown or forced move 15’. |
| | Stone Tomahawk (range 25’): Might vs. Evasion, damaging attack |

Leadership of the Wapungo is determined by force of arms. At any time, a
member of the tribe who seeks the chieftainship may challenge the
current ruler to single combat - to the death. The current chief,
Bloodfist, was given this name because at the very start of his
ascendancy fight, his tomahawk broke, and he was forced to pummel his
opponent to death with his bear knuckles.

Bloodfist stands almost seven feet tall, and his body piercings are
many. A plume of bony spikes adorn the center of his shaved head and run
down his spine. His muscular arms are likewise decorated. In
conversation, he is known to slam his fist when provoked to anger or
impatience.

Bloodfist knows a warrior when he sees one, and though the PCs are
foreign in look and armament, he can sense none the less that they are
powerful. As such, unless they provoke his wrath, he will seek to make
allies of them.

### The Dragon’s Maw

If questioned about the tall mountain that looms over the island, the
Wapungo will reveal its name and say that the volcano has remained
dormant for ages, ever since the gods of the ruined city abandoned
kingship of the island. Legends say, though, that once a new king lays
claim to Starfall Island, fire again will fly from the Dragon’s Maw.

The upper region of the island can be accessed by navigating the
Cascading Caverns, but the Wapungo avoid that place at all costs on
account of the Troglodyte cannibals who lair within. These cave
dwellers, the Wapungo say, are distant relatives of theirs who took to
the eating of man flesh and were cursed with hatred of the sun for their
sin. Recently, Wapungo have gone missing farther from the caves then has
ever been dangerous before, and the people fear that the cannibals are
extending their reach (actually, these kidnappings have been by Thorn
for his sacrifices).

### The Scepter of Kings

Like the Wapuny, the Wapungo also fear the great ruined city of gods and
know of the power of the Scepter of Kings. If Bloodfist can gain the
party’s allegiance, he will quest them with the retrieval of this
powerful relic. If they will deliver the scepter to him, Bloodfist
promises them one tenth of the star crystals mined after the Wapunies
are wiped out.

### A Tribe Divided

If they are particularly investigative, the party will discover that not
all of the Wapungo are happy with Bloodfist’s rule. They complain of two
things.

First, though he has been chief for almost five years, he has not yet
taken a bride to be chieftainess, a longstanding tradition among their
people. A close advisor to Bloodfist, named Vulture, reveals that the
chief has spoken little to him of this matter beyond shouting at him “My
bride is on her way!” in a fit of anger when Vulture pressed the issue.

Bloodfist’s second and more egregious failing is that he has
systematically moved the Wapungo patrols away from the Great Chasm, and
has made similar strategic decisions that hint of the slackening of the
war against the Wapuny. Bloodfist’s response to this is that he is
executing a feint to catch the Wapuny off guard, though few of the
battle hungry warriors are satisfied with this answer.

### The Bride to Be

About three years ago, Chief Bloodfist was out on a hunting expedition
and made camp near a cool jungle spring. During his sleep that night, he
was visited in dream by a beautiful maiden dressed in white. She
introduced herself as Asha, telling the chief that she was the goddess
who had caused the star to fall so long ago. She said that she would be
visiting the island soon to reclaim the Great Star, and that he had been
chosen to pave her way. Promising to reveal more information in the
future, Asha told Bloodfist to come often to this spring - to drink and
sleep beside it that she may visit him again in dreams.

Since then, the chief has regularly made lone expeditions to the spring
about a half day from the Wapungo camp. Over the years, Asha has wooed
Bloodfist, promising to be his bride upon her arrival and to make him a
god-king over the island. She has revealed that the star contains a
great deal of her power, and that without it she is quite vulnerable.
Asha claims she cannot set foot on Starfall Island until she is certain
that the star may be reclaimed. To this end, she has convinced Bloodfist
to lighten the attacks on the Wapunies in preparation for a final
assault, and also to search for a means to retrieve the Scepter of
Kings. Once the scepter is in the chief’s hands, she will be confident
that she can enter the island in safety and help lead her groom to
victory.

In truth, Chief Bloodfist has been enchanted by the magic of the
necromancer, Thorn. He has ensorcelled the spring that the chief has
been visiting, and whenever Bloodfist drinks and sleeps beside it, Thorn
visits him in dream disguised as Asha. If the chief can ever acquire the
Scepter of Kings, Thorn will beckon him to meet Asha in the Dragon’s
Maw, where he will slay the chief and claim the Scepter for his own.

Bloodfist has not revealed this information to anyone, so he obviously
will not tell the PCs without good reason. Some or all of the
information may come out of him, depending on the situation. The
following are a few ideas of how and when the party may learn of the
chief’s secret:

-   A party member speaks also of dreaming of Asha

-   Bloodfist learns of Asha’s grave and the secrets revealed therein

-   The party gains the chief’s trust, such as by delivering the Scepter
    of Kings.

-   The party discovers the chief while sleeping at the dream spring
    (perhaps by following him there).


## Location G: The Cascading Caverns

Northwest of the Great Chasm lies the mouth of the Cascading Caverns,
curtained by a waterfall. These caverns are the most likely way to gain
access to the northernmost region of the island, which is separated from
the rest by an almost unscalable cliff nearly a mile high.

### Darkness and Water

From a distance, the mouth of the cave is concealed by the waterfall,
but it is easily spotted once the party is closer. Within, the caverns
form a maze-like network of tunnels, chambers, pits, and shafts. If the
party undertakes this journey ask them the pace that they are moving
through the caverns: cautious, normal, or quick. At a normal pace, the
journey takes about 2 days. Cautious travel increases this to 3 days
while a quick pace reduces travel time to 1 day.

With the pace of travel established, read or summarize the following:

+++ {.CalloutInformation}
*Darkness and water. That is all these caverns have to offer. For hours on end, you navigate the maze of tunnels, chambers, pits, and shafts - and the entire journey you are haunted by the ever-encroaching shadows and the unnerving hum of the underground streams that flow at every turn. Though you can sense that you are making progress in altitude, every two steps forward are met by one step back as you meet another dead end, expend another torch, and fall down yet another rockslide. Occasionally, echoing throughout distant passageways, the monotonous sound of running water gives way to an otherworldly noise - like the howl of a dying animal, yet filled with malice and hunger.*
+++

At this point, you can ask the players what they are doing in order to
make the journey a success. For example, some characters might be
skilled spelunkers or navigators, and could use Logic or Perception to
keep the group on course. Another character might be a fire elementalist
who uses his magic to maintain a constant light source for the group.

Based on the player’s descriptions, allow each PC to make a single
action roll, CR 16, using an attribute that makes sense to the
situation. If the party is travelling at a cautious pace, they have
advantage 2 on these rolls. If travelling quickly, they have
disadvantage 2. Once everyone has rolled, your job is to make *every
roll matter*.

In this situation, the party should eventually make it through the maze,
but for every failed roll you can introduce some sort of hazard or twist
that results from the failure. Listed below are several options. Choose
one for each failed roll, or come up with twists of your own.

-   The journey takes an extra half day.

-   The party has disadvantage 2 on their rolls to resist the trap at
    the beginning of the next encounter (see below).

-   The party suffers from a special form of the *demoralized* bane. It
    does not go away until they have made 2 successful action rolls.

-   One member of the party suffers the *fatigued* bane.

-   Half of the party falls down a pit or similar natural hazard. Roll a
    damaging attack using 1d20 + 1d4 vs Evasion. Half of the damage
    inflicted is lethal damage.

### Howls in the Dark

After narrating the results of the party’s actions, proceed with the
following.

+++ {.CalloutInformation}
*It’s been hours - maybe an entire day’s trek - since you entered this maze, when you find yourselves in a narrow corridor with a small brook running through it. On either side of the river are ledges about three feet wide. The walls extend upward ten feet to similar ledges above you, though you see no obvious way of accessing them. Echoing from the distant edge of the cavern, you can hear what can only be a small waterfall feeding this stream. As you make your way cautiously alongside the water, you notice its speed and ferocity quickly increasing, accompanied by a gushing sound from the darkness ahead.*
+++

The party has walked into a trap set by the Troglodytes who make their
home in these caverns. These cave dwellers are an offshoot of the
Wapungo race who took to cannibalism in ages past. As their taste for
human flesh increased, so did their distaste for the things that men
love, especially the sun - and so the Troglodytes retreated into the
darkness of these caverns. Though they are still tall like their
brethren, centuries of cave dwelling have caused these creatures to
become pale skinned and wiry in frame. In addition to the traditional
bone piercings of the Wapungo, the troglodytes install bone instruments
in their larynx, which transform their voice into an otherworldly
piercing howl that strikes fear in the hearts of their prey, rendering
them unable to act.

The corridor suddenly fills with rushing water that the cannibals had
dammed back. Immediately after the trap springs, the Troglodytes attack,
half from the ledges above and the other half rushing to hand-to-hand
combat. Ask the PCs what they do in response to the water and allow them
to make action rolls against CR 14 using an appropriate attribute.

You get to arrange all of the combatants in an exciting position, such
as the party divided in two groups in separate caverns. Then, every
character who succeeded at the action roll, may modify their starting
position by 30’.

The cave dwellers are adept climbers and exceptionally stealthy. Use
these features to make this battle an exciting challenge of out
maneuvering. The troglodytes will use their howl to stun foes and follow
up with damaging attacks. When they are in a disadvantageous position,
they will climb the wall or jump from one ledge to the other in order to
evade the PCs.

\NextTableColumns{OLT{.33}OLT{.67}}

\FloatingTable

| **Troglodytes** (6) | 30’ speed, climbing |
| - | - |
| Hit Points: 7 | Agility 4 (1d10) |
| | Fortitude 3 (1d8) |
| **DEFENSES** | Might 3 (1d8) |
| Toughness: 13 | Perception 2 (1d6) |
| Evasion: 14 | Presence 4 (1d10) |
| Resolve: 14 | |
| | **FAVORED ATTACKS** |
| | **Bone Tomahawk**: Might vs. Evasion, damaging attack |
| | **Howl** (targets 15’ square): Presence vs. Resolve - disadvantage 2, inflicts stun |


### Adjusting Difficulty

For parties smaller than 5 PCs, reduce the number of troglodytes so that
there is one more monster than PCs. For large groups, add 3 hit points
to the troglodytes’ maximum for each PC beyond the fifth.

### Aftermath

If the party is defeated, you do not have to kill them outright.
Instead, consider them to have been captured by the cannibal troglodytes
who are preparing them for a ritual feast. They’ll have to use their
ingenuity to escape their prison cells and get back to the quest at
hand.

Otherwise, the party can continue their trek through the caverns, which
will eventually take them to the foot of the Dragon’s Maw. The
troglodytes, having been defeated once, will avoid further contact with
the PCs if possible.


## Location H: The Dragon’s Maw

The inactive volcano that keeps watch over Starfall Island is known by
the locals as the Dragon’s Maw. Though it has not been active in
centuries, legends tell that when a new king rises to control the
island, the Dragon’s Maw will spit fire once again. As the party’s
approach the foot of the mountain, read the following:

+++ {.CalloutInformation}
*The Dragon’s Maw is the one sight that you can view from any point on Starfall Island, and throughout your time here it has kept watch on your movements like a detached king observing the petty trifles of his subjects from his balcony.*

*The mountain was impressive from a distance, but now that you stand at its feet, you are humbled by its immensity and power. A long natural stone path, molded ages ago by flowing magma, slopes up the rocky crag, where you can see a single cavernous entrance about halfway up the volcano.*
+++

The climb requires no special equipment or effort, given the natural
staircase, and the party can ascend the mountain in safety. The cave
enters into the necromancer’s lair, where the party will discover that
the volcano is already showing signs of becoming active again. A short
trip down a cavernous corridor leads to the shaft of the volcano. As the
party travels down the hall, they can see a faint orange glow dancing on
the walls near its end, and the temperature grows hotter and hotter with
each step.

### Level Up

Reaching the entrance to the Dragon’s Maw is an important milestone, and
could be a good place to reward the party with another level. They
should be level 3 before they will have a good chance at defeating the
necromancer.

Upon reaching 3rd level, PCs gain 9 attribute points and one new feat.
Remember to recalculate hit points for anyone who increases their
Fortitude, Presence, or Will.

When the party enters the shaft, read the following:

+++ {.CalloutInformation}
*You stand now inside the Dragon’s Maw - in the very heart of the volcano, which obviously bears life still. Hundreds of feet above you, the shaft gives way to the open sky. Molten lava sputters and spurts throughout the chamber, occasionally spitting a gout of flame into the air. A wide ledge encircles the magma, and several small alcoves are dug out of the volcano’s cavernous walls, which are decorated with curtains of bone. Rocky outcroppings, like incomplete bridges, jut sporadically out into the center of the churning magma.*
+++

The volcano is a logical place for a final showdown with Thorn, though
the party may encounter him here at different stages of the story. If
they arrive here long before the plot demands a confrontation between
the two, you can choose to have the necromancer away, and instead use
this location as an opportunity for the players to learn more about him
by exploring the alcoves and side chambers described below.

If Thorn is present, read or summarize the text below. Alternatively,
this could be a good chance for a verbal back-and-forth between the
party and their nemesis. Many players enjoy having a final conversation
of sorts before a final confrontation. If your narrative demands it, you
might only use the first paragraph below, saving the second for if and
when things come to blows.

+++ {.CalloutInformation}
*Standing alone upon one of the rocky outcroppings on the other side of the volcano is a man robed in what must have once been fine cloth but is now so tattered with age and blackened with ash that he wears it like a death shroud. His skin is pale and gaunt, and his face is a canvas painted with woe and malice.*

*“She will be mine again!” he shouts as his hands extend, one calling forth a pillar of magma from the pit below, the other weaving dark energies towards the curtains of bones that line this unhallowed chamber. They rattle and dance upon the walls. “Come to me, my minions!” sputters the necromancer “And feed our master the very souls of those who would stand between me and my beloved...my Asha.” With that, the bones complete their transformation, taking the shape of large demonic monstrosities - and the necromancer begins weaving another spell.*

This combat should be both challenging and epic. Hopefully, combatants
will be diving from one ledge to another, avoiding the molten rock
below, to head off one another. It will be a game of cat and mouse as
Thorn attempts to keep his distance from the party using the terrain and
his minions for aid.

The skeletons cannot deal much damage, but if they are ignored, they
will nickel and dime the party to death while also providing the
necromancer with increased mobility. They are fragile and fall easily,
though, so it might be a good time to remind the players of their
multi-targeting options.

Thorn will start off with his dark shroud attack, aiming to blind any
PCs who are obviously equipped for ranged or magical combat. He’ll rely
mostly on his flame and shadow attack to deal damage and save deathly
siphon for when he is forced into melee or severely damaged. Every
round, he can call lava on one foe near a ledge, so he will direct his
minions to use their forced move attacks to force PCs into position.

### Adjusting Difficulty

For parties smaller than 5 PCs, reduce the number of skeletons so that
there are 3 more skeletons than PCs. For large groups, add 10 hit points
to Thorn’s maximum for each PC beyond the fifth. For groups of 8 or more
PCs, Thorn receives 2 boss actions instead of 1.

### The Shimmering Pool

In one alcove is a cistern of water that gently rises with steam caused
by the ambient heat. If the party looks into it, they see the image of a
cool spring somewhere in the jungle. This cistern is Thorn’s means of
scrying, and he keeps it ever focused on the spring where Bloodfist
dreams of Asha. If appropriate, players may experience the
Spring of Dreams encounter (Event 5) while gazing into this pool.

### Thorn’s Journal

Among a variety of nondescript items scattered atop a makeshift boulder
table, the party discovers a journal kept by Thorn. The earliest entry
dates back about ten years ago. The text below summarizes the contents
of the journal for anyone who spends time reading it:

+++ {.CalloutInformation}
*This worn leather bound journal looks like it has seen years of abuse. It is water damaged in spots and the pages curl from years of residing in volcanic heat. Reading through the log, you learn the sad tale of its keeper, a man named Eric Thorn. In another life, some ten years ago when the first entry is dated, he was a successful merchant - though from what you can tell, a ruthless and at times dishonest one. The journal tells also of the love between Eric and a woman named Asha, who seems to have tempered his merciless pursuit of coin.*

*About five years ago, the two were married, and struck out on the seas to make a new life in a new town. Eric writes of his excitement of being free of the shackles of old acquaintances and business partners - of the chance to do things the right way from the start. But then his ship is wrecked on this island, and Asha is killed, along with all the other passengers.*

*After the death of his wife, the journal skips several days, which is odd because up until this point Thorn has kept to his nightly journaling almost religiously. When it picks back up, the man has changed. He writes hastily and in fragmented thoughts, and it is clear that the ruthlessness that fueled his life for so long has returned.*

*Now he writes of dark deals with unseen shadows - of skeletal guardians, dark rituals, and voices calling to him from deep within the island. He plots the destruction of the natives and the raising of an undead army. Every entry, though, still reveals a mad love for his precious Asha, whom he regularly writes to directly, hinting that soon he will bring her back.*

*His writings refer frequently to some great power with whom he has been communing named Asgaroth. For a few years after the shipwreck, Thorn seems to speak of this power as a partner, but eventually he refers to him as master. It isn't clear who or what this Asgaroth is, but you can make out two things: he is imprisoned on this island and Thorn is working to free him.*

+++

### The Altar

Atop one of the bridges that overlooks the magma is a crude stone altar
encrusted with blood. It is equipped with rope ties to restrain
sacrifices. Asgaroth demanded such sacrifices as a means to twist his
necromancer puppet further down the path of evil in hopes that having
performed such wicked acts would seal Thorn’s fate as his servant.

### Sealing the Demon’s Tomb

If a character enters the volcano in possession of the Scepter of Kings,
he will immediately realize that he has the power to cause the volcano
to erupt, and even direct the flow of lava. This process takes time, of
course, and Thorn will not let it go unchecked if he is present. If a PC
has the time to undertake this task, he can fill the Great Chasm with
molten lava, which will eventually cool and entomb Asgaroth under such
depth that the spell of greed will be broken on the Wapuny and the
Wapungo.

Read or summarize this as a way of wrapping things up:

+++ {.CalloutInformation}
*Wielding the Scepter of Kings, you command the power of a great bloodline of royal sorcerers that flows through you. At your command, the magma churns, bubbles, and rises. You feel a malignant force from deep within the bowels of the island fighting you with all its will, but its power is weakened by the shackles imprisoning it.*

*A shimmering barrier of force envelopes you and your companions as the magma surges upward, carrying you to the summit of the Dragon’s Maw and spilling forth over its edge. As the molten lava continues to flow, you harness the power of the scepter to direct its course, and it winds its way down the river that flows from the mountains, crawling inch-by-inch until it cascades into the Great Chasm like a fiery waterfall. Lava flows mightily, filling the chasm completely, when a horrid cry billows forth from its depths, echoing across the island.*

*With the dark power of the fallen star buried far beneath the land, its spell of greed is broken. In the days that come, the natives of this land make peace, and prosper for a good long while. One day, however - centuries from now perhaps - another brave band of heroes will be called upon when the fortune that started this quest comes to its fulfillment.*

 \ \
A star once fallen upon the land, \
Brings sword and axe and spell at hand. \
For planted deep like evil seed \
It fills heart, soul, and mind with greed. \
 \ \
Shoulders broad and voices tiny \
Ceaseless war of clashing armies. \
In sleep, the beauty whispers well, \
But her wormtongue song is ever fell. \
 \ \
A royal staff in hands upright \
Shall end the long, eternal fight. \
But try you might, and try you may \
**The star will rise another day**.

+++

# Event Encounters

## Event 1: Drawing a Line

This event serves to show the party of the conflict between the Wapuny
and the Wapungo, and perhaps force them into choosing a side.

Wherever this encounter takes place, describe to the party the following
scene.

+++ {.CalloutInformation}
*Your travels are interrupted by the sound of battle ahead. Closing the distance to a good vantage point, you can see two forces - one of about a dozen tiny lizard folk, and the other made up of four towering humans. The two forces hurl racial insults as axes swing and blowguns fire. The lizards are nimble and acrobatic in combat, using the terrain and an innate climbing ability to outmaneuver their opponents. The humans, on the other hand are ferocious and powerful, like raging bulls. Though different in number, the forces seem equal in power, and for every human casualty, three lizard men fall.*
+++

If the party doesn't intervene, you can flip a coin to decide who wins,
or make a decision based on the direction you would like the story to
take. If the party does intervene, they might make new friends and new
enemies depending on the outcome.

## Event 2: Mining Expedition

This event serves to reveal to the party the complete withdrawal of the
Wapungo troops. It should occur somewhere between the Great Chasm and
the Wapuny camps.

+++ {.CalloutInformation}
*As your journey continues, you come across a short line of Wapuny, walking with stone mining tools and making some sort of wretched sound that you can only assume is the lizard equivalent of a whistle. They've got a pep in their step and smiles on their faces.*
+++

If Grik survived the opening scene, he will be leading this pack and
speak for his people.

The Wapuny report that the Wapungos have pulled back their forces. They
had noticed a slackening of patrols recently, but scouts have determined
that the stinky flesh bags have made a complete withdrawal, so this crew
has been the first sent to mine the star crystals.

If the party attempts to convince the Wapunies not to go to the Chasm,
they will be hard pressed to do so. Though, if Grik is present, he is
still quite thankful to the PCs for saving his life and may be persuaded
depending on their argument.


## Event 3: The Dream Speaker

In this encounter, one member of the party is visited in dreams by Thorn
disguised as Asha. Use this encounter when the party is making camp in
the wild. It serves as a means to persuade the party to carry out
Thorn’s schemes for him.

Choose one party member to receive this dream, though read the text and
conduct the encounter in front of the whole group, so that everyone can
enjoy the drama. Players, of course, should be encouraged not to act on
information that their characters to not know.

If the party is keeping watch, then whoever is on watch at this point
will notice that the dreamer is disturbed in sleep as the dream goes on,
tossing and turning until eventually waking up with a shout of the name
“Asha!”.

+++ {.CalloutInformation}
*The night is uncomfortably warm when you make camp, though you have found a relatively defensible position beside a cool, clear spring. Eventually, you succumb to sleep, despite the humidity and pestering mosquitoes.*

*Soon a dream disturbs your sleep, more real than any you've had before. You see a young woman approach, robed in a white bridal gown and beautiful as the stars. “My name is Asha…” she speaks.*
+++


Use this dream to communicate whatever sort of message you want to the
party. This largely depends on what has already happened in the
adventure, but the following are some ideas to get you started:

-   If the party has the scepter or has already made plans for it, Asha
    tells them that she is a shipwreck survivor imprisoned by
    the Wapungo. If they bring the scepter, she is certain their chief
    would ransom her for it.

-   If the party has discovered Asha’s grave, then the vision will tell
    them that her spirit is trapped on this cursed island and that the
    only way to free her is to convince her husband, who resides in the
    Dragon’s Maw, to release the spell that is keeping her here in vain
    hopes of returning her to life.



## Event 4: Shadow Assassins

This encounter can be used after the party has incurred the
necromancer’s wrath, such as by stealing Asha’s ring or refusing to
deliver the Scepter of Kings. During the evening, just as the sun is
setting, the necromancer's shadows attack the party.

+++ {.CalloutInformation}
*The sun is setting and you are making preparations to camp, when from the darkness you are attacked. Shadowy figures, like ghosts formed of the very night, swarm without warning. They take myriad shapes - tall, strong humans; short, limber lizard folk; and long serpentine half snake men.*
+++

\NextTableColumns{OLT{.33}OLT{.67}}

| **Shadow** (6) | 30’ speed, incorporeal |
| - | - |
| Hit Points: 10 | Agility 3 (1d8) *Advantage 3 on rolls to hide in darkness. |
| | Fortitude 3 (1d4) |
| **DEFENSES** | Might 2 (1d6) |
| Toughness: 13 | Perception 3 (1d6) |

| | Spirit Touch (melee): Entropy vs. Toughness, damaging attack <br /> Special: 2 points of damage from a successful attack is automatically applied as lethal damage |
| | Curse of the Grave (melee): Entropy vs. Toughness, inflicts sickened bane |


### Adjusting Difficulty

For parties smaller than 5 PCs, reduce the number of shadows so that
there is one more shadow than PCs. For large groups, add 3 hit points to
the shadows’ maximum for each PC beyond the fifth.

### Aftermath

This fight could be very difficult for the party, potentially ending in
defeat. If the PCs are defeated, the story doesn’t have to end there.
The shadows were likely sent for a purpose - to retrieve the scepter or
Asha’s ring, for example. Allow them to achieve their purpose and leave
the heroes for dead, only to rise and fight again when dawn comes.



## Event 5: The Spring of Dreams

This event should occur somewhere near the Wapungo camp, and serves to
give the party a clue that something is not right with Chief Bloodfist
if they have not already figured it out.

+++ {.CalloutInformation}
*You rose early today, before the sun, and decided to get a head start on your trek. It’s been about half an hour since you left your camp when you come upon an interesting sight.*

*A lone man lies sleeping on a bedroll stretched out beside a cool spring of water. He is tall, muscular, and adorned with all manner of strange bone piercings. He sleeps restlessly, tossing and turning, until finally awaking with a startled cry of “Asha!”.*
+++

The man is Chief Bloodfist, and he is out on one of his monthly solo
journeys to visit his bride-to-be. The party can make of this encounter
what they like, and their response depends largely on what information
they have already gathered about the necromancer’s wife. If they play
their cards right, this could be their opportunity to convince the chief
that his dreams are a trick. See Location F: The Wapungo Camp for more
information about Bloodfist’s dreams.



## Event 6: The Dragon Awakens

This event can occur anywhere on the island, and it serves as a device
to warn the party that trouble is brewing and draw their attention to
the Dragon’s Maw. Use it to mark a significant milestone in the
necromancer’s scheme. An ideal point is if he gains the Scepter of
Kings, then this event can signal the start of the Ritual of the Dead.

+++ {.CalloutInformation}
*Your dealings are interrupted by a great tremor as the earth quakes beneath you, and your attention is drawn to the volcano that looms over the island. Slowly, smoke rises from its peak in short puffs that soon accumulate into a massive column. When the column grows large enough, it begins billowing out to the sides, encircling the mountain. Throughout the day, you watch as the clouds of ash and smoke slowly extend their dark fingers further and further around the island. This is no natural effect, and it can have no good end. The sleeping dragon has awoken.*
+++

Within three days, the island will be completely shrouded in darkness
from the ashy clouds spewed forth from the Dragon’s Maw - and night and
day will have little distinction. If Thorn does have the scepter, then
the third day will mark the completion of his ritual, and his army will
be loosed. If not, then the dark clouds will prove a bane to the natives
of the island, eventually spelling their demise due to the loss of the
sun.


## Event 7: Death Unleashed

This event marks the completion of the Ritual of the Dead. The text
below serves as a sort of dramatic interlude and should be read to the
party even though their characters cannot witness all of the events
firsthand.

+++ {.CalloutInformation}
*From deep within the Dragon's Maw, a triumphant cackle echoes throughout the island, projected far and wide by some otherworldly power. A lone man, robed in black, stands within the smoky volcano and finishes the final words of a days-long incantation. He holds high the Scepter of Kings and then hurls it into the magma below.*

*Immediately, fire leaps in a terrible column that touches the clouds of smoke above, and they ignite. For a moment, the entire sky is set ablaze as flame dances throughout the clouds. When it expires, ash begins to fall upon the land like snow, and every flake that touches the earth brings death.*

*The skeletal remains that litter Starfall Island take form - the dead scattered about the Great Chasm from the War with no Beginning, the snake men of the ruined city who have laid still for centuries, every Wapuny, Wapungo, and other intelligent creature who never received a proper burial - all rise to form an army of rattling bones unleashed upon the island.*

*And somewhere, a small Wapuny gazes at the flame pouring from the mountain and repeats the ancient prophecy: “When a king lays claim to Starfall Island, the Dragon will spit flame once again.”*
+++

If the party has managed to convince Chief Bloodfist of Asha’s trickery,
then they may stand a chance at defeating the undead army - if they can
convince the Wapuny and Wapungo to fight together.

If Chief Bloodfist is still under the spell of Asha or if he has been
killed, this event could spell the doom of the Wapuny tribe. The Wapungo
and the undead will assault the lizardfolk at the same time, wiping them
out completely unless the party manages to hatch a particularly clever
scheme. Soon after, the Wapungo will mine the Great Star in a mad frenzy
of greed, and the Demon Lord Asgaroth will be set free. From there, you
can take the story in whatever direction you please.

Asgaroth has been lying to Thorn this entire time. He possesses no power
to return Asha to life, but he has twisted the necromancer’s heart to
commit such evil deeds that Thorn will continue to serve the demon out
of a twisted dependence. Asgaroth, having fully enthralled the Wapungo
in greed, will claim them as his own, and they shall serve him in
unleashing havoc upon the world.

damaging attack is reduced to 5 hit points.

## Battlefield Sentinel

You are able to make two additional opportunity attack each round.

## Boon Focus

Choose one boon. As long as you are targeting a single creature, you no
longer have to make an action roll to invoke the boon - success is
automatic. When multi-targeting, you gain advantage 2 on your roll to
invoke the boon.

## Fleet of Foot

Your movement speed is increased by 10 feet.

## Hospitaler

You can use your action to allow one ally to make a free attempt to all
resist banes affecting him. Your ally has advantage 1 (using the d20)
for this resist attempt. Additionally, you gain advantage 1 whenever you

attacks. When multi-targeting using the chosen specialization, reduced
the disadvantage penalty by 2.

## Potent Bane

Choose one bane. Whenever your enemies attempt to resist this bane, they
have disadvantage 1 (using the d20) on this roll.

## Tactical Inspiration

Once per round, you may use a minor action to grant an ally within sight
advantage 2 on their next attack roll.

# Banes

Each bane described below is a condition that can be inflicted upon a
foe. Every bane lists a power level and one or more relevant attributes.
In order to inflict a bane, a character must possess an attribute score
in *one* of the listed attributes equal to or greater than the bane’s
power level.

The bane descriptions also indicate which defense the attacker must
overcome in order to inflict the bane. If more than one defense is
indicated, the GM should choose the one most logical to the story being
told by the attacker. For example, a rogue inflicting the *blinded* bane
by throwing sand in a foe’s eyes would roll Agility vs. Evasion, while a
necromancer cursing an enemy with a spell of blindness would roll
Entropy vs. Toughness.

Most banes have a duration of *resist ends*, which means that an
inflicted target is affected by the bane until successfully shaking it
off with a *resist action*. If a target fails three resist rolls against
a bane, the bane can no longer be resisted. It persists for an extended
duration indicated in the bane description.

## Blinded
**Power Level 4** (Agility, Energy, Entropy) \
**Defense:** Evasion or Toughness \
 \ \
Attacks and perception rolls have a 50% chance of failing automatically. \
 \ \
**Duration**: Resist ends (fail x 3 = 1 minute)

## Charmed
**Power Level 4** (Enchantment) \
**Defense:** Resolve \
 \ \
Targets of human intelligence treat you more favorably. Less intelligent
creatures may(at your option) instead be charmed to treat you as their
closest and loyal friend. \
 \ \
**Duration**: Resist ends (fail x 3 = 24 hours)

## Demoralized
**Power Level 2** (Agility, Energy, Enchantment, Entropy,
Illusion, Might, Presence, Persuasion) \
**Defense:** Resolve \
 \ \
Target has disadvantage 1.
 \ \
**Duration:** Resist ends (fail x 3 = 1 minute). **Special:** this bane
may be resisted as a minor action.

## Dispel
**Power Level 1** (Abjuration) \
**Defense:** Resolve \
 \ \
Make an Abjuration roll. You can dispel temporary boon effects of a
maximum Power Level equal to (Abjuration roll - 10) ÷ 2. This bane does
not affect permanent or inherent magical effects. \
 \ \
**Duration:** Instantaneous

## Dominated
**Power Level 5** (Enchantment) \
**Defense:** Resolve \
 \ \
Creatures of animal intelligence or lower fall completely under your
control, like puppets. **Duration:** Resist ends (fail x 3 = 1 hour)

## Fatigued
**Power Level 5** (Entropy) \
**Defense:** Toughness \
 \ \
This bane has multiple stages. Each time it is inflicted, the target’s
current stage increases by 1. Effects are cumulative.

- **Stage 1:** Disadvantage 1 on all non-attack rolls.

- **Stage 2:** Lose attribute bonus to defense scores

- **Stage 3:** Disadvantage 1 on all attack rolls.

- **Stage 4:** Speed is reduced to 10’.

- **Stage 5:** Unconsciousness.

- **Stage 6:** Death.

 \ \
**Duration:** This bane cannot be resisted as normal. Instead, every 24
hours of complete rest OR application of the restoration boon reduces
the fatigue stage by 1.

## Forced Move
**Power Level 2** (Might, Movement, Energy) \
**Defense:** Toughness \
 \ \
Move the target 5 feet for every 2 points in the activating attribute. \
 \ \
**Duration:** Instantaneous

## Incapacitated
**Power Level 5** (Agility, Entropy, Enchantment) \
**Defense:** Toughness or Resolve \
 \ \
The target is immobile and unconscious. The bane can be broken without a
resist roll by a firm shake, shove, splash of water, or similar effect. \
 \ \
**Duration:** Resist ends (fail x 3 = 1 minute)

## Intimidated
**Power Level 4** (Enchantment, Might, Presence Persuasion) \
**Defense:** Resolve \
 \ \
The target suffers disadvantage 1 on all attacks that don’t include you
as a target. **Special:** When triggered by an exceptional success on a
damaging attack, you may target a creature other than the foe damaged by
your attack. \
 \ \
**Duration:** Resist ends (fail x 3 = 1 minute)

## Immobile
**Power Level 0** (Agility, Enchantment, Entropy, Energy, Alteration, Might) \
**Defenses:** Evasion, Resolve, or Toughness \
 \ \
Target cannot move from their current space. If inflicted using Might,
the attacker is grappling and thus cannot leave the target’s reach

caster and/or allies. Every boon lists a power level and one or more
relevant attributes. In order to invoke a boon, a character must possess
an attribute score in *one* of the listed attributes equal to or greater
than the bane’s power level. Additionally, the caster must make a
successful attribute roll with a Challenge Rating of 10 + twice the
boon’s power level. The boon descriptions also indicate how long the
boon takes to invoke.
