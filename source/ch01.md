# Character Creation

Before you can start telling your story, you’ll need a character to play. This chapter will offer you step-by-step instructions to creating your own hero. In *Open Legend*, you typically begin as a level one character. As you complete quests and gain more experience adventuring, you’ll level up and gain more power. These rules explain how to create a character starting at level one. Later, you’ll learn what to do when you level up.

Before reading on, take a minute and think of your favorite fantasy movies, books, or video games.

*Who were the characters you identified with?*

*Who inspired you?*

Now that you’ve got some of your favorites in mind, let’s create your character.

### Choose an Example Character & Modify It

For anyone who feels they could benefit from some inspiration, you can easily make a copy of any of these spreadsheets (they include formulas for doing most all of the calculations for you), and then increase or decrease attribute scores, as well as add or remove feats. Be sure to adjust the **Level** field to get the correct calculations for attribute & feat points at your current character level.

## Step 1: Choose Attributes

Attributes are the backbone of every character in *Open Legend*. They define what your character can and can’t do--the spheres he excels in, as well as his greatest weaknesses. Whenever your character attempts a heroic action in Open Legend, you’ll look to your attributes to see how well you succeed or fail.

In *Open Legend*, attributes are divided into four categories: physical,
social, mental, and supernatural.

A character’s skill with each attribute is expressed as a score from 0 (completely unpracticed) to 9 (superhuman). The average commoner or craftsmen usually has scores ranging from 1 - 3 in several physical, social, and mental attributes. Supernatural attributes are generally reserved for characters of power and note.

The Attributes at a Glance tables provide a quick overview of some of the common actions that each attribute will help you accomplish.

In *Open Legend*, you get to define your character’s strengths and weaknesses by choosing the attributes that fit your character concept. Described below are several methods by which you can assign your attributes.

### Quick Build

  If you are new to roleplaying games, or are just looking to get your character built quickly, choose one of the attribute sets listed in the Attribute Quick Builds table. Assign the scores listed to the attributes that define the type of character you want to play. The rest of your attributes begin with a score of zero.

<div class="table-centered"></div>
| ATTRIBUTE QUICK BUILDS |
| - |
| **Specialized Hero** |
| 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2 |
| **Well-rounded Hero** |
| 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 1 |
| **Jack of All Trades** |
| 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1 |


### Custom Build

If you would like more control over your attributes, you can purchase them to create your own set. With this method, at first level, you have a budget of 40 attribute points to spend, and the cost of each score is defined in the Purchasing Attributes table. The highest any score can reach at first level is 5, and you don’t have to spend all of your points at character creation.

<div class="table-no-body table-centered"></div>
| PURCHASING ATTRIBUTES |
| - |
| |
<div></div>
| Attribute Score | Cost |
| - | - |
| 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 6 |
| 4 | 10 |
| 5 | 15 |

### Archetype Build
In the Archetype Attribute Builds table, several common fantasy archetypes are listed. If you are envisioning a character similar to one of these, you can just take one of these sets as written, or swap out some of the attributes for others.

<div class="table-no-body"></div>

| | Movement 3 | |


### Record Attribute Dice

Every attribute score above 0 grants you bonus dice to increase your chance of success. Consult the Attribute Dice table for each of your attributes and record the appropriate dice. (You’ll learn what to do with these dice later on.)

<div class="table-no-body"></div>
| Attribute Dice |
| - |
| |
<div></div>
| Attribute Score | Attribute Dice |
| - | - |
| 1 | 1d4 |
| 2 | 1d6 |
| 3 | 1d8 |
| 4 | 1d10 |
| 5 | 2d6 |

<br><br>

> ### Roll Them Bones
> If you are new to gaming, you may not be familiar with dice notation, such as 2d6.
>
> As you play Open Legend, you’ll often need to roll dice to determine the outcome of actions. **Dice notation** is a shorthand way of indicating which dice to roll.
>
> Every die roll is indicated by a formula such as 3d6. The number before the *d* indicates how many dice to roll, and the number after the *d* indicates how many sides those dice have.
>
> So, 3d6 means that you roll three six-sided dice.
>
> 4d4 indicates four four-sided dice.
>
> And so on.

<br><br>

## Step 2: Calculate Defenses and Hit Points

When an enemy tries to attack you--whether with a breath of flame, a deft sword thrust, or a mental assault--it will first need to overcome your defense. You have three defense scores, and each one protects you from different types of attacks. The higher your defense, the better you are at avoiding or shrugging off whatever your foes throw at you.

<div class="table-no-body"></div>
| Toughness = 10 + Fortitude |
| - |
| |

**Toughness** protects you from attacks that test your endurance, bodily health, or sturdiness. For example, foes attempting to poison you, push you off a cliff, or crush you with an iron maul will target your toughness.

<div class="table-no-body"></div>
| Evasion = 10 + Agility |
| - |
| |

**Evasion** protects you from attacks that test your quickness and ability to dodge. Your enemies would need to overcome your evasion in order to hit you with a fireball, shoot you with an arrow, or stab you with a rapier.

<div class="table-no-body"></div>
| Resolve = 10 + Presence + Will  |
| - |
| |

**Resolve** represents your character’s ability to resist mental domination and stand brave in the face of danger. Enemies who wish to magically charm you, deceive you with illusions, or frighten you must target your resolve.

<div class="table-no-body"></div>
| Hit Points = 2 x (Fortitude + Presence + Will) + 10 |
| - |
| |

*That is, add your Fortitude, Presence, and Will scores. Multiply the total by 2. Finally, add 10.*

**Hit Points** (or HP) are an abstract measure of how well you can ignore pain, avoid deadly blows, and maintain a presence on the battlefield in spite of wounds or exhaustion. If they reach zero, you fall unconscious and are at risk of death.

## Step 3: Purchase Feats

While your character’s attributes define his skill at accomplishing
heroic tasks, his **feats** are what make him unique among other
characters. Feats allow you to customize your character, granting him
the ability to accomplish specific actions exceptionally well.

For example, two different characters who specialize in melee combat might both start with a Might score of 5. However, one character is a swashbuckling pirate, so he takes the *Combat Momentum* feat to allow him to move deftly from one foe to the next like a whirling dervish. The other, a battle-scarred berserker, takes *Berserker* so that she
can fly into a frenzied rage in order to decimate her foes.

### Choose your feats

Feats are purchased using feat points. At 1st level, you have 6 feat
points to spend. Any leftover feat points may be saved for the future.

You can read the feat descriptions in a searchable database
[*here*](http://www.openlegendrpg.com/feats).

If your character is based on a specific archetype, you may want to
start with the feat selections recommended below:

<div class="table-no-body"></div>
| Archetype Feat Recommendations |
| - |
| |

| Barbarian | Ranger | Monk |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Berserker | Master Tracker | Fleet of Foot 1 |
| Reckless Frenzy | Attack Specialization 1 (Longbow) | Martial Focus (Unarmed) |
| | Multi-target Attack Specialist 1 (melee) | Combat Momentum |

<br>

| Paladin | Elemental Mage | Mind Mage |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Attribute Substitution (Presence > Might)  | Area Manipulation 1 | Hallucination |
| Armor Mastery (Scale Mail) | Attack Specialization 1 (Cold) | Potent Bane (Phantasm) |
| Multi-target Attack Specialist (Area) | | |

<br>

| Assassin | Cleric | Druid |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Martial Focus (Dagger) | Restorative Adept 1 | Armor Specialization 2 (Scale Mail) |
| Lethal Strike 1 | Armor Specialization 1 (Scale Mail) | Ferocious Minions |
| Master Shifter 1 | Boon Focus 1 (Shapeshift) | |

<br>

| Shadowdancer | Bard | Arcane Protector |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Lethal Strike 1 | Tactical Inspiration 2 | Defensive Expert 1 |
| Boon Focus 1 (Teleport) | Restorative Adept 1 | Boon Focus (Teleport) |

## Step 4: Choose Your Race

While your character in *Open Legend* can be a human, there are also a number of other races to choose, from old standards like elves and dwarves to the more obscure dragonbloods and celestials.

The standard races are described below, along with several defining racial features typical to members of that race. Choose your character’s race, and then choose **one** of the listed racial features.

### Celestial

**Pure-hearted.** Any good-aligned creature you encounter is friendly toward you by default rather than neutral. Circumstances can alter this, but even if rumors or actions you’ve taken would influence a good creature negatively, it remains one step friendlier than it otherwise would have been.

**Divine Insight.** Drawing on a supernatural connection to a deity, you gain otherworldly insight. Once per game session, you can choose a topic relevant to the story. The GM shares some information about that topic which might be useful. If you’ve just failed a *Learning* attribute roll and use this ability, the GM decides whether to give you information related to that roll or to give you knowledge that is completely unrelated.

**Trustworthy**. Once per session, you can choose to inspire trust in another character via your good-hearted nature. That character believes that you have their best interest in mind and seeks your advice on something that is troubling them, sharing a secret that they would not normally share with a stranger.

**Divine Intervention.** As a divine agent, you are defended by your creator. Once per game session, when you are subject to a *Finishing Blow* while your hit points are below 1, you automatically heal to a hit point total of 1.

### Dragonblood

**Legendary Bloodline**. Having dragon’s blood, you command the respect of those who practice the Arcane arts. You are assumed to have knowledge and a destiny for greatness in the Arcane arts, and others treat you with deference. This influence could guarantee your placement within an Arcane College, grant you an apprenticeship with a famous Archmage, or cause a magic-user who does not know you well to follow a prescribed course of action based on your advice if the question is one of Arcane knowledge.

**Dragonspeak.** Like the great wyrms of your ancestry, you have practiced the ways of sneaking hidden charms and subliminal messages within everyday conversation. Once per session, when you converse with an intelligent creature for at least five minutes, you will learn one useful secret of the GM’s choosing about the creature.

### Dwarf

**Warrior’s Code.** As a veteran warrior, you command respect even from foes. Once per session, you can use this ability to cause an enemy or group of enemies to extend special concessions or favorable treatment toward you via an unspoken warrior’s code. The GM decides what these concessions look like. For example, your enemies might choose to trust you to come quietly and not shackle you, or overlook an insult that would have otherwise have been cause for bloodshed.

**Stone Sense.** While underground you may fail to find what you’re looking for, but you can never be truly lost. You can always find your way back to the entrance through which you entered.

**Dwarven Resilience**. Once per game session, you can automatically succeed a *Fortitude* action roll of Difficulty Level equal or less than your Fortitude score.

### Elf

**Elven Senses.** Your keen senses allow you to notice details that others typically miss. Once per game session, you can use this ability to notice something out of the ordinary. For example, you might spot a hidden passage behind a bookcase, a trace of blood under the fingernails of another character, or a wig that is not quite convincing. If you use this ability after failing a *Perception* roll, the GM decides whether you notice the initial target of your roll or a different detail.

**Sylvan Ally**. Creatures of nature can sense your deep respect for the natural order. Wild animals give you a wide berth, Druids give you the benefit of a doubt by assuming that you do not have destructive intentions, and you can typically gain an audience with the chief of a small local tribe by virtue of your race’s reputation for defending nature.

### Feytouched

**Whisperer of the Wild.** Once per game session, you can ask a single “yes” or “no” question of a plant or animal within earshot. The plant or animal automatically trusts you at least enough to answer the question truthfully. You receive the answer by way of an inner sense, and so this ability cannot be used for further two-way communication.

**Fey Innocence.** Your fey blood gives you a childlike quality that can melt even the coldest of hearts. Once per game session, you can leverage your fey innocence to turn an enemy and cause them to take pity on you. The enemy might choose to look the other way when you’ve done something illegal, forgive a debt you could never pay, or vouch in your favor before the authorities.

### Half-Orc

**Orcish Shakedown**. While others might convince with a silver tongue, you speak the universal language of fear. Once per game session, if you make a show of physical force, you can use your *Might* attribute for a *Persuasion* roll. If your *Persuasion* score is already equal to or greater than your *Might* score, you get Advantage 1 on the roll.

**Orcish Scent.** Your sense of smell is similar to that of a wild beast. As a focus action, you can discern the number and relative location of living creatures within 60’. With an additional focus action you can lock onto a particular scent and maintain its relative location as long as it remains within 60’.

### Halfling

**Halfling Luck.** Once per game session, in a moment of need, you can call on luck shine to upon you. The GM decides what form this luck takes. For example, an attack that was meant for you might target an ally instead, you may discover a secret passage to escape from a rolling
boulder, or a town guardsman decides to overlook your crime because you happen to have grown up on the same street.

**Halfling Courage.** You have a brave heart for such a small person. Once per game session, as a free action you can cancel the effects of any bane relating to fear or a penalty associated with negative morale.

### Human

**Human Nobility.** Being of high birth, you are treated as a benefactor by the lower classes. They will trust and help you in the hopes of being rewarded for their efforts. You are also treated as a peer by lesser nobles and can typically request an audience with them. In addition, representatives of the law generally assume you to be beyond reproach unless they are presented with compelling evidence to the contrary.

**Human Learning**. You have a knack for picking up new skills. Once per game session, provided you are not under pressure from an inordinately tight deadline, you can automatically succeed at a non-attack action roll that relates to some craft, trade, skill, or similar work provided it is Difficulty Level 2 or less.

## Step 5: Choose Starting Equipment

In a typical game of *Open Legend*, your character will start with the gear he needs for the basic adventuring life. The GM, however, may decide that the campaign starts under special circumstances (such as the entire party caged in a slave convoy) that might dictate otherwise.

Usually, though, you begin with a Wealth Score of 2, and may select up to three items of Wealth Level 2 and any number of items of a lesser Wealth Level. See chapter 4 for rules concerning Wealth as well as equipment details.

Instead of purchasing equipment a la carte, you may also elect to choose one of the following starting packages built for common character archetypes. After selecting your equipment, be sure to note any changes to your defenses or other statistics.

<div class="table-no-body"></div>
| Archetype Starting Packages |

| Barbarian | Ranger | Monk |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Maul | Longbow | Quarterstaff |

## Step 6: Describe Your Character

*Open Legend *is a role playing game, which means your character will need more depth than attributes, feats, and gear. To make your character come to life, add the following details. If you can’t think of anything yet, try to fill in the blanks during your first couple of play sessions as you get to know your character better.

**A heroic name.** Be sure to check with your GM to see if he has any particular setting in mind. Phil the Fighter would feel quite out of place next to Therilas Windcaster and Gorion Skullcleaver.

**Two exceptional physical traits.** Think of the first two features that other characters notice when they see you. Do your eyes glow red when you are angry? Are you seven feet tall? Is your hair a rainbow hue?

**Two defining social traits. **Maybe you stutter when you’re nervous. Maybe you don’t trust anyone until they’ve proven themselves to you. Or, perhaps, you are a winsome bard who almost always talks in sing-song. Your two social traits should be characteristics that others will learn shortly after getting to know you.

**A secret.** Your secret is something that other characters probably won’t find out about until they’ve gotten to know you quite well. It’s also a seed for great adventure that the GM can weave into his campaign. Here are a few examples of character secrets to give you some ideas:

*Before Volkor changed his name and began wandering the land as a barbarian sellsword, he was heir to the throne.*

*Sir Thomas Tuckburrough served as an assassin for the local thieves guild until a job went bad and he murdered an innocent child--that’s when he began his road to the priesthood.*

*Talia was raised as a Druid of the Briar Rose, but she fled the Order out of distaste for their violent ways. Now, she fears the reprisal of her ex-brethren at every turn.*

### Tell Your Story

With your character created, you are all ready to start playing *Open Legend*. Whether you’re playing with old friends or complete strangers, and whether you’re completely new to roleplaying games or an experienced veteran, the following tips will help ensure a fun time for everyone at the table.

### Relax

*Open Legend *gives you a chance to step out of everyday life for a few hours and into a fantastical world where you can perform heroic deeds. Pour the Mountain Dew or grab a beer, order some takeout or pop open the pretzels--but whatever you do, shake the dice like your life depends on it and have fun. If you’re playing a dwarf, maybe pull out your best Scottish accent. If your character’s a witch, squint your eyes and speak in riddles. If you’re no expert thespian, think of other ways to add to the fun: play adventurous music on your phone, illustrate the party’s escapades, and so on.

### Respect the GM

If you’ve never GM’d before, you might not realize all the work that goes into it. More likely than not, your GM worked for hours to put her campaign together and prep for this session. Go with her storyline, overlook any accidental inconsistencies, and don’t cause a ruckus just for the sake of causing a ruckus. If there’s a dispute over the rules, accept the GM’s final ruling and agree to look it up later for the sake of the game.

### Respect the Other Players

Different people play roleplaying games for different reasons. Some enjoy the tactical, chess-like combat encounters. Others just want to tell an epic story. Still others are born actors, reveling in every conversation with every character. Whatever it is that you enjoy about playing *Open Legend*, just remember that not everyone else at the table may enjoy the same aspects. Part of the GM’s duty is to give everyone a chance to shine, but you can do your part too by not hogging the spotlight and by encouraging the other players to have fun, whatever
that means for them.

## Beyond First Level

As the legend you are creating unfolds and grows in danger and magnitude, your character’s power will grow to match the challenge. This gain in power is called leveling up. The GM decides when characters level up. When your character does level up, you’ll have a few decisions to make.

### New Attribute Points

Upon leveling up, you gain 9 new attribute points to spend. You can use these to increase your current attributes or buy completely new ones. The cost to increase an attribute is equal to the new score. So, for example, to raise your Might from 3 to 4 would cost 4 attribute points. The cost to purchase a brand new attribute is summarized in the Attribute Overview Table.

Until you reach 5th level, the maximum attribute score is 5. From levels 6 to 9, the maximum is equal to your level.

You do not have to use all of your attribute points at once, any remaining attribute points can be saved for use at future levels.

<div class="table-no-body"></div>
| Attribute Overview |
| - |
| |

| Attribute Score | Cost | Attribute Dice |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1 | 1 | 1d4 |
| 2 | 3 | 1d6 |
| 3 | 6 | 1d8 |
| 4 | 10 | 1d10 |
| 5 | 15 | 2d6 |
| 6 | 21 | 2d8 |
| 7 | 28 | 2d10 |
| 8 | 36 | 3d8 |
| 9 | 45 | 3d10 |

### New Feats

Whenever you gain a level, you gain 3 feat points to purchase new feats. You do not have to use all of these at once, and any remaining feat points can be saved for future levels.

See [*Feats*](http://www.openlegendrpg.com/feats) to view the complete list of feats to choose from.

### New Hit Points

In *Open Legend*, attributes are the means by which your hit points increase. If you want your character to be able to take more hits, increase either your Fortitude, Presence, or Will attribute. As outlined in the default hit point formula, you’ll gain 2 hit points each time you raise one of those attributes by one.
