# Character Creation

Before you can start telling your story, you’ll need a character to play. This chapter will offer you step-by-step instructions to creating your own hero. In *Open Legend*, you typically begin as a level one character. As you complete quests and gain more experience adventuring, you’ll level up and gain more power. These rules explain how to create a character starting at level one. Later, you’ll learn what to do when you level up.

Before reading on, take a minute and think of your favorite fantasy movies, books, or video games.

*Who were the characters you identified with?*

*Who inspired you?*

Now that you’ve got some of your favorites in mind, let’s create your character.

### Choose an Example Character & Modify It

For anyone who feels they could benefit from some inspiration, you can easily make a copy of any of these spreadsheets (they include formulas for doing most all of the calculations for you), and then increase or decrease attribute scores, as well as add or remove feats. Be sure to adjust the **Level** field to get the correct calculations for attribute & feat points at your current character level.

## Step 1: Choose Attributes

Attributes are the backbone of every character in *Open Legend*. They define what your character can and can’t do--the spheres he excels in, as well as his greatest weaknesses. Whenever your character attempts a heroic action in Open Legend, you’ll look to your attributes to see how well you succeed or fail.

In *Open Legend*, attributes are divided into four categories: physical,
social, mental, and supernatural.

A character’s skill with each attribute is expressed as a score from 0 (completely unpracticed) to 9 (superhuman). The average commoner or craftsmen usually has scores ranging from 1 - 3 in several physical, social, and mental attributes. Supernatural attributes are generally reserved for characters of power and note.
